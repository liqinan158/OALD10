The same tests are taken by children across the country. In a very few areas children take an <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/eleven-plus" title="eleven-plus definition"><span class="ndv">eleven-plus</span></a> exam to decide where they will go for their secondary education.</span><span class="p">In secondary schools exams are usually held at the end of each school year to assess students' progress. The most important exams are the national <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/gcse" title="GCSE definition"><span class="ndv">GCSE</span></a> exams that children take at 16. Schools are free to choose which of several <span class="eb">examination boards</span> they use to set and mark GCSE exams. GCSEs are marked on a nine-point scale, with nine as the highest mark and one the lowest. U, meaning ' <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/unclassified" title="unclassified definition"><span class="ndv">unclassified</span></a>', indicates that the student has not been given a grade.

Many students take GCSE exams in seven or eight subjects, sometimes more. <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/diploma" title="Diploma definition"><span class="ndv">Diploma</span></a></span> exams offer an alternative to GCSE and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/a-level" title="A level definition"><span class="ndv">A level</span></a> exams and are based on more practical work as preparation for particular jobs.<a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/btec#btec_topg_1" title="BTECs definition"><span class="ndv">BTECs</span></a> (Business and Technology Education Council) and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/nvq#nvq_topg_1" title="NVQs definition"><span class="ndv">NVQs</span></a> (National <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/vocational" title="Vocational definition"><span class="ndv">Vocational</span></a> Qualifications) are other less academic alternatives to GCSEs and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/a-level" title="A levels definition"><span class="ndv">A levels</span></a>.</span><span class="p">Students who do well in their GCSEs usually go on to take A level exams two years later. <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/a-level" title="A levels definition"><span class="ndv">A levels</span></a> are marked on a five-point scale, A to E, with an additional grade A*, and U for unclassified. Most study four or five subjects at AS level in the first year and then three at A2 level in the second year. They must achieve fairly high grades in order to be offered a place at university.</span><span class="p">In Scotland students sit <span class="eb">Scottish Qualifications Certificate</span> exams which, at <span class="eb">National 5</span> level, are the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/equivalent#equivalent_1" title="equivalent definition"><span class="ndv">equivalent</span></a> of GCSEs.

Many take an <span class="eb"><span class="ndv" href="honor_subentryg_1:honor_topg_3" tofix="">honours</span> degree</span> which is awarded in one of several <span class="eb">classes</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= grades)</span>. The highest class is a first. The second class is often split between upper second and lower second (a 2:1 and a 2:2), and below that is the third class. If a student does not meet the standard for an honours degree, he or she may be awarded a <span class="eb">pass degree</span>.</span><span class="p">In the US there are no national exams like those in Britain but many states have their own assessment tests that vary from state to state. Students at school and university usually take one or more exams as part of their <span class="eb">grade assessment</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= a mark A to D, and F for 'fail')</span> which shows how well they have done in each class. At colleges and universities these exams are often called <span class="eb">midterms</span> or <span class="eb">finals</span>, and during the year students have exams in all or most of their classes.</span><span class="p">People who wish to study at a US university usually have to take one of several <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/standardize" title="standardized definition"><span class="ndv">standardized</span></a> tests</span>.

Standardized tests often do not test how much people know about a subject, but how strong their skills are in areas like reading and solving problems. People do not pass or fail but instead each college or university decides on the lowest score it will accept. Test scores are never the only factor to be considered in deciding whether to offer a place to a student.</span><span class="p">Some professions require people to pass special exams before they are qualified to practise. Lawyers in the US, for example, must pass the <span class="eb">bar exam</span> in the state in which they wish to work, to show that they know the laws of that state.</span></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_a_level_1_gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_a_level_1_gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_a_level_1_us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_a_level_1_us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
