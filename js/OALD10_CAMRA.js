Until the beginning of the 20th century there were many small, family-run breweries in the US, but then <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/prohibition#prohibition_sng_3" title="Prohibition definition"><span class="ndv">Prohibition</span></a> came into effect and it became illegal to sell alcohol. By the time Prohibition was cancelled, most of the small breweries had gone out of business. Today, most beer is produced by a few large breweries, all of whom make similar products. However, Americans have begun to appreciate different sorts of beer, and many <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/microbrewery" title="microbreweries definition"><span class="ndv">microbreweries</span></a></span> have opened, as they also have in Britain. These <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/brew#brew_1" title="brew definition"><span class="ndv">brew</span></a> and serve high-quality beer made in traditional ways. This movement has even led some of the large breweries to return to traditional methods and materials. People drink beer after playing sports or while watching them, but wine is considered more appropriate to drink with a meal.</span><span class="p">Many makes of beer in the US are sold in both bottles and cans, though microbrewery beers come only in bottles. In some states beer can be sold in supermarkets, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/gas-station" title="gas stations definition"><span class="ndv">gas stations</span></a> and local <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/convenience-store" title="convenience stores definition"><span class="ndv">convenience stores</span></a>.
