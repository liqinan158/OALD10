Other famous colleges include Corpus Christi, King's, Magdalene, Queens' and Trinity. Most take both male and female students.

They are generally also thought to be the best universities to study at. An Oxbridge degree makes a good impression with many employers, and graduates of these universities may have an advantage when applying for jobs. Although efforts are made to attract more students from <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/state-school" title="state schools definition"><span class="ndv">state schools</span></a></span>, many of the <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/undergraduate" title="undergraduates definition"><span class="ndv">undergraduates</span></a></span> at each university have been educated at <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/independent-school" title="independent schools definition"><span class="ndv">independent schools</span></a></span>. The upper class have traditionally sent their children to Oxbridge, and many prime ministers and politicians studied there. To many people, Oxford and Cambridge seem very remote places where only the very <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/privileged" title="privileged definition"><span class="ndv">privileged</span></a> can study.</span><span class="p">Students at Oxford and Cambridge must be accepted at one of around 30 partly independent <span class="eb">colleges</span>. Students are chosen after an <span class="eb">interview</span> in the college they want to go to. The teachers are called <span class="eb"><span class="ndv" href="don_subentryg_1:don_topg_2" tofix="">dons</span></span>. Each college has its own teaching and research staff, who are <span class="ndv" href="fellow_subentryg_1:fellow_topg_2" tofix="">fellows</span> of the college, and its own buildings, including <span class="eb">hall</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= where members of the college eat)</span>, a library, a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/chapel" title="chapel definition"><span class="ndv">chapel</span></a>, and rooms for students to live in during the term. The buildings are often arranged round a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/quad" title="quad definition"><span class="ndv">quad</span></a></span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= square)</span>. Until the 1970s colleges were single-sex, but now all Oxford colleges and almost all Cambridge colleges are mixed. The universities provide other facilities for all students to use, including laboratories, lecture rooms and libraries.</span><span class="p">The teaching system is different from that at most other universities. Students have <span class="eb"><span class="ndv" href="tutorial_subentryg_1:tutorial_topg_2" tofix="">tutorials</span></span>, called <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/supervision" title="supervisions definition"><span class="ndv">supervisions</span></a></span> at Cambridge, at which they read their essays to their <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/tutor#tutor_1" title="tutor definition"><span class="ndv">tutor</span></a></span>, a fellow who is a specialist in what they are studying. There are usually no more than one or two students at a tutorial and tutorials are arranged by the college. Students also go to lectures that are arranged by the university and open to all students. Terms are short, and students are expected to prepare for them in the vacations. Final examinations at Oxford are called <span class="eb">schools</span>, and at Cambridge the <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/tripos" title="tripos definition"><span class="ndv">tripos</span></a></span>. Undergraduates at Oxford and Cambridge study for a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/ba" title="BA definition"><span class="ndv">BA</span></a></span> degree, but after a period of time graduates can convert their BA to an <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/ma#ma_2" title="MA definition"><span class="ndv">MA</span></a> (Oxon)</span> or an <span class="eb">MA (Cantab)</span> without doing any further study. <span class="ei">Oxon</span> is short for <span class="ei">Oxoniensis</span>, and <span class="ei">Cantab</span> for <span class="ei">Cantabrigiensis</span>, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/latin#latin_1" title="Latin definition"><span class="ndv">Latin</span></a> for ‘of Oxford’ and ‘of Cambridge’.</span><span class="p">At Oxford students sometimes have to wear <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/gown" title="gowns definition"><span class="ndv">gowns</span></a></span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= black <span class="ndv" href="robe_subentryg_1:robe_topg_2" tofix="">robes</span>)</span>, at dinner in hall or when they go to see the college <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/principal#principal_1" title="principal definition"><span class="ndv">principal</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= head)</span>.
