The expression <span class="ei">Catch-22</span> has now entered the English language, meaning an unpleasant situation from which you cannot escape because you need to do one thing before doing a second, but you need to do the second thing before doing the first: <span class="ei">We're in a Catch-22 situation.</span><span class="blockquote"><span class="p-g"><span class="wrap_open">“</span><span class="p">There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind … Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them.
