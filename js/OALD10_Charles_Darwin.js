The different types of animals and plants that he found, especially on the Galapagos Islands in the Pacific, led him to believe that living things develop differently in different places over long periods of time. At that time, most western people believed that all things were created by God in seven days. Darwin returned to England in 1836 and spent the next 23 years collecting evidence to support his theory. When he published <span class="ebi">On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection</span> (1859) it caused much argument and anger because it seemed to disagree with the story of creation in the Bible. Most people now accept the main points of Darwin's theory, and many see it and the Bible as two ways of saying the same thing, but others, especially in the US, interpret the Bible account <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/literally#literally_sng_1" title="literally definition"><span class="ndv">literally</span></a> and believe that only <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/creationism" title="creationism definition"><span class="ndv">creationism</span></a>, also called <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/creation-science" title="creation science definition"><span class="ndv">creation science</span></a>, should be taught in schools.</span></span></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_charles_darwin_1_gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_charles_darwin_1_gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_charles_darwin_1_us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_charles_darwin_1_us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
