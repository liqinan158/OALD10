Her name before she married was Lady Diana Spencer. The Spencer family are <span class="ndv" href="descend_pvg_1:descend_topg_2" tofix="">descended</span> from the English kings <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/charles-ii" title="Charles II definition"><span class="ndv">Charles II</span></a> and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/james-ii" title="James II definition"><span class="ndv">James II</span></a>, and Diana's father was the 8th Earl Spencer.
