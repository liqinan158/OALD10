Children's education from 5 to 16 is divided into four <span class="eb">key stages</span>. Key stage 1 covers ages 5–7, key stage 2 ages 7–11, key stage 3 ages 11–14 and key stage 4 ages 14–16. English, mathematics, science, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/computing" title="computing definition"><span class="ndv">computing</span></a> and physical education are <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/compulsory" title="compulsory definition"><span class="ndv">compulsory</span></a> at all key stages. Art and Design, Design and Technology, Geography, History and Music are compulsory at key stages 1, 2 and 3. <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/citizenship" title="Citizenship definition"><span class="ndv">Citizenship</span></a> is compulsory at key stages 3 and 4. A modern foreign language is compulsory at key stages 2 and 3. Pupils may take several other subjects in addition to those that are compulsory. All schools must teach religious education at all key stages, and secondary schools must teach sex and relationship education. In Wales the Welsh language is also studied. Detailed information and advice about what children should be taught is given in official <span class="eb">programmes of study</span>. A disadvantage for teachers has been the increase in the number of documents they are expected to read and the reports they have to write. The National Curriculum does not apply in Scotland, where individual schools decide which subjects and topics to teach.</span><span class="p"><span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/attainment" title="Attainment definition"><span class="ndv">Attainment</span></a> targets</span> are set within each subject and children's progress is checked at the ages of 7 and 11, when they complete <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/national-curriculum-test#national_curriculum_test_topg_1" title="National Curriculum Tests definition"><span class="ndv">National Curriculum Tests</span></a> (<span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/nct" title="NCTs definition"><span class="ndv">NCTs</span></a></span>). At the age of 16, at the end of key stage 4, pupils take <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/gcse" title="GCSE definition"><span class="ndv">GCSE</span></a> exams, which are also based on material covered in the National Curriculum. Some children struggle to reach the required standard. If they have learning difficulties, they may be <span class="eb"><span class="ndv" href="statement_subentryg_2:statement_topg_4" tofix="">statemented</span></span>, which means they are given an official document saying that they have <span class="eb">special educational needs</span>.</span><span class="p">The NCTs allow education authorities to compare standards between different schools.

State governments are responsible for deciding the curriculum for primary and secondary schools. The curriculum is often the cause of debate between people who want to emphasize basic skills, such as reading, writing and mathematics, and others who see the curriculum as a political issue and want schools to teach respect for other cultures or history from the point of view of African Americans, or to offer less traditional topics.</span></span></span></div><span class="topic-g"><span class="prefix">Topics </span><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/topic/education?level=c1" title="Topic education"><span class="topic" href="l2:people:education?cefr=c1"><span class="topic_name">Education</span><span class="topic_cefr">c1</span></span></a></span><div class="collapse" hclass="collapse" htag="div"><span class="unbox" id="gcse_unbox_2" unbox="snippet"><span class="box_title" onclick="toggle_active(this)">Oxford Collocations Dictionary</span><span class="body"><span class="p"><span class="eb">GCSE</span> is used before these nouns: <ul class="collocs_list"><li bord="n" class="li">exam</li><li bord="n" class="li">examination</li><li bord="n" class="li">pass</li><li class="li">…</li></ul></span><span class="xref_to_full_entry">See <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/collocations/gcse" title=" definition in Collocations">full entry</a></span></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_gcse_1_gb_1_abbr" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_gcse_1_gb_1_abbr.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_gcse__us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_gcse__us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
