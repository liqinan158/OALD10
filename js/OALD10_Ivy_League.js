The most highly respected of these groups is the <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/ivy-league" title="Ivy League definition"><span class="ndv">Ivy League</span></a></span> in the north-eastern US. Its most famous members are <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/harvard-university" title="Harvard definition"><span class="ndv">Harvard</span></a> and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/yale-university" title="Yale definition"><span class="ndv">Yale</span></a> Universities, whose strong competition in various sports is like that between <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/oxford#oxford_2" title="Oxford definition"><span class="ndv">Oxford</span></a> and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/cambridge" title="Cambridge definition"><span class="ndv">Cambridge</span></a> Universities in Britain. The other members of the Ivy League are Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Brown University, Princeton University, and the University of Pennsylvania.

They are very expensive, with high <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/tuition" title="tuition definition"><span class="ndv">tuition</span></a> fees, although <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/scholarship" title="scholarships definition"><span class="ndv">scholarships</span></a></span> are available to help students who cannot pay for themselves. People who are educated in the Ivy League have a good chance of finding a well-paid job, and many political leaders have been to Ivy League universities. Many other colleges and universities in the US offer a high standard of education but none has the status of the Ivy League institutions.</span></span></span></div><span class="topic-g"><span class="prefix">Topics </span><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/topic/education?level=c2" title="Topic education"><span class="topic" href="l2:people:education?cefr=c2"><span class="topic_name">Education</span><span class="topic_cefr">c2</span></span></a></span></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_ivy_league_1_gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_ivy_league_1_gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_ivy_league_1_us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_ivy_league_1_us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
