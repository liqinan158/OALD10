Regan and Goneril later treat Lear badly and Cordelia finally comes to rescue him with a French army. In the battle that follows, however, she is captured and killed. Lear dies too and the play ends. It is one of the greatest of Shakespeare's plays and is known for its speeches about the relationship between parents and children.</span></span></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_king_lear_1_gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_king_lear_1_gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_king_lear_1_us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_king_lear_1_us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
