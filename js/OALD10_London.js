Its many bridges, including <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/london-bridge" title="London Bridge definition"><span class="ndv">London Bridge</span></a>, are a famous sight. Probably the most famous is <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/tower-bridge" title="Tower Bridge definition"><span class="ndv">Tower Bridge</span></a>, close to the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-tower-of-london#the_tower_of_london_topg_1" title="Tower of London definition"><span class="ndv">Tower of London</span></a>.</span><span class="p">The Tower was built in the 11th century. In the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/medieval" title="medieval definition"><span class="ndv">medieval</span></a> period London grew rapidly in size and importance. <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/westminster-abbey" title="Westminster Abbey definition"><span class="ndv">Westminster Abbey</span></a> and the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-guildhall#the_guildhall_topg_1" title="Guildhall definition"><span class="ndv">Guildhall</span></a> date from this time, and the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-palace-of-westminster#the_palace_of_westminster_topg_1" title="Palace of Westminster definition"><span class="ndv">Palace of Westminster</span></a> became the meeting place of Parliament.

As London's population increased, new streets, squares and parks were added, and many public buildings.

In the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-west-end" title="West End definition"><span class="ndv">West End</span></a> there are theatres, cinemas, museums and shops.

People from other parts of Britain sometimes think that it is very noisy and dirty.
