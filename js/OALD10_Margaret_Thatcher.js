She became a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/member-of-parliament" title="Member of Parliament definition"><span class="ndv">Member of Parliament</span></a> in 1959 and a member of the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/cabinet" title="Cabinet definition"><span class="ndv">Cabinet</span></a> in 1970 when she was made <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/secretary-of-state" title="Secretary of State definition"><span class="ndv">Secretary of State</span></a> for education and science. In 1975 she defeated <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/edward-heath" title="Edward Heath definition"><span class="ndv">Edward Heath</span></a> in a party election for leader and became Prime Minister in 1979 when the Conservative Party won the general election. She believed that the state should not <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/interfere#interfere_sng_1" title="interfere definition"><span class="ndv">interfere</span></a> in business, and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/privatize" title="privatized definition"><span class="ndv">privatized</span></a> many industries that were owned by the state. She reduced the power of the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/union" title="trade unions definition"><span class="ndv">trade unions</span></a> by a series of laws, and defeated the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/miner" title="miners definition"><span class="ndv">miners</span></a> in the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/miners-strikes#miners_strikes_topg_1" title="miners' strike definition"><span class="ndv">miners' strike</span></a> in 1985. She wanted people not to rely on the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/welfare-state" title="welfare state definition"><span class="ndv">welfare state</span></a>, and instead to pay for their own <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/healthcare" title="healthcare definition"><span class="ndv">healthcare</span></a>, education and pensions. People were often critical of Mrs Thatcher's policies, and blamed her for the decline of many British industries and high unemployment. However she was seen as a very determined and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/patriotic" title="patriotic definition"><span class="ndv">patriotic</span></a> prime minister, and she became especially popular after the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-falklands-war#the_falklands_war_topg_1" title="Falklands War definition"><span class="ndv">Falklands War</span></a>. Because of this she was often referred to as the 'Iron Lady'. After winning three general elections, she was forced to <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/resign" title="resign definition"><span class="ndv">resign</span></a> in 1991 by members of her own party who criticized her attitude to the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-european-union" title="European Union definition"><span class="ndv">European Union</span></a>. She was succeeded as Prime Minister by John Major.
