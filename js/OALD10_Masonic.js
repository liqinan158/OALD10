There was a guild for each <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/craft#craft_1" title="craft definition"><span class="ndv">craft</span></a>. Its members were excellent <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/craftsman" title="craftsmen definition"><span class="ndv">craftsmen</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= people with the special skill of making things with their hands)</span> and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/journeyman" title="journeymen definition"><span class="ndv">journeymen</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= trained workers)</span>. Titles given to modern Masons reflect these origins. New members are admitted as <span class="eb"><span class="ndv" href="apprentice_subentryg_1:apprentice_topg_2" tofix="">apprentices</span></span> and may go on to the higher rank of <span class="eb">fellowcraft</span> or <span class="eb">journeyman</span>, and finally <span class="eb">master mason</span>. Tools used by <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/stonemason" title="stonemasons definition"><span class="ndv">stonemasons</span></a> are still used in the society's ceremonies.</span><span class="p">During the 17th century the guilds became popular with rich gentlemen who gradually took them over. They developed into secret societies whose religious beliefs and practices led to opposition from many, including the <span class="ndv" href="romancatholic_d_1" tofix="" xt="andv">Roman Catholic</span> Church. In 1717 the <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-grand-lodge" title="Grand Lodge definition"><span class="ndv">Grand Lodge</span></a></span> was founded in London and became the most important branch of the society with authority over other branches or <span class="ndv" href="lodge_subentryg_1:lodge_topg_2" tofix="">lodges</span>. The Grand Lodge of Scotland was founded in 1736.</span><span class="p">Most Masons today belong to the professional and middle classes and are lawyers, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/civil-servant" title="civil servants definition"><span class="ndv">civil servants</span></a>, businessmen, etc., though members of the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/aristocracy" title="aristocracy definition"><span class="ndv">aristocracy</span></a> and the royal family have also been Masons. In Britain, new members are only admitted at the invitation of existing Masons and have to go through a special <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/initiation" title="initiation definition"><span class="ndv">initiation</span></a></span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= welcoming)</span> ceremony in which they promise not to tell anyone else the secrets of the society. It is commonly believed that they also learn special signs and words, and the Masons' <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/handshake" title="handshake definition"><span class="ndv">handshake</span></a></span>, which they can use in public to identify themselves to other Masons. In the US some of the details of <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/masonic" title="Masonic definition"><span class="ndv">Masonic</span></a> practices are different: for example, people who wish to become Masons must ask to join, because Masons are not allowed to invite others to become Masons.</span><span class="p">In Britain, because Masons keep their affairs secret, Freemasonry has often been viewed with <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/suspicion" title="suspicion definition"><span class="ndv">suspicion</span></a>. Many people believe that Masons in positions of power give other members of the society an unfair advantage. Masons themselves deny such practices and emphasize the social aspects of the movement, and the work they do for charity. In the US, Freemasonry is more accepted. Perhaps the best known Freemasons in the US are a group called <span class="eb">Shriners</span>. Shriners are well known for their <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/circus" title="circuses definition"><span class="ndv">circuses</span></a> which are held every year to raise money for charity work, including hospitals that the Shriners run.</span><span class="p">Many other social clubs in the US which call themselves <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/fraternal#fraternal_sng_1" title="fraternal definition"><span class="ndv">fraternal</span></a> organizations</span> have titles and ceremonies that are based on those of the Masons.</span></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_masonic__gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_masonic__gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_masonic__us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_masonic__us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
