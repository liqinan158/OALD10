Some Old English words had disappeared, while others remained, even though they had the same meaning as those of French or Latin origin, for example <span class="ei">freedom</span> and <span class="ei">liberty</span>. Compared with Old English, many more words of Middle English can be understood by speakers of modern English. However, the range of styles and spellings in surviving literature suggest that there was no single way of writing Middle English. The ancient letters, called <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/rune" title="runes definition"><span class="ndv">runes</span></a>, found in Old English soon stopped being used, with only the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/thorn" title="thorn definition"><span class="ndv">thorn</span></a> (þ) surviving into the 15th century. There were also changes to pronunciation, especially the pronunciation of vowels. Long, stressed vowels had been pronounced similarly to those in other European languages, for example the ‘i’ in <span class="ei">fine</span> was originally pronounced<span class="phonetics"> <div class="phons_br" geo="br" hclass="phons_br" htag="div" wd="e"><a class="sound audio_play_button pron-uk icon-audio" onclick="document.getElementById('OALD10_pron_e_1_gb_2_abbr').play();" style="cursor: pointer" title="e pronunciationEnglish" valign="top"></a><span class="phon">/iː/</span></div> <div class="phons_n_am" geo="n_am" hclass="phons_n_am" htag="div" wd="e"><a class="sound audio_play_button pron-us icon-audio" onclick="document.getElementById('OALD10_pron_e__us_1').play();" style="cursor: pointer" title="e pronunciationAmerican" valign="top"></a><span class="phon">/iː/</span></div></span>but in late Middle English it became<span class="phonetics"> <div class="phons_br" geo="br" hclass="phons_br" htag="div" wd="eye"><a class="sound audio_play_button pron-uk icon-audio" onclick="document.getElementById('OALD10_pron_eye__gb_2').play();" style="cursor: pointer" title="eye pronunciationEnglish" valign="top"></a><span class="phon">/aɪ/</span></div> <div class="phons_n_am" geo="n_am" hclass="phons_n_am" htag="div" wd="eye"><a class="sound audio_play_button pron-us icon-audio" onclick="document.getElementById('OALD10_pron_eye__us_1').play();" style="cursor: pointer" title="eye pronunciationAmerican" valign="top"></a><span class="phon">/aɪ/</span></div></span>.
