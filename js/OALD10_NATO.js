After the end of the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/cold-war" title="cold war definition"><span class="ndv">cold war</span></a> in the late 1980s, and the joining of East and West Germany in 1990, it was suggested that NATO should become a political organization rather than a military one. In 1994 NATO started a major new approach called Partnership for Peace, to make political and military links stronger between NATO and the central and eastern European countries. Its members are now Albania, Belgium, Britain, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey and the US. Nato's main offices are in Brussels.</span></span></span></div><span class="topic-g"><span class="prefix">Topics </span><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/topic/politics?level=c1" title="Topic politics"><span class="topic" href="l2:politics_and_society:politics?cefr=c1"><span class="topic_name">Politics</span><span class="topic_cefr">c1</span></span></a></span></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_nato__gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_nato__gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_nato__us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_nato__us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
