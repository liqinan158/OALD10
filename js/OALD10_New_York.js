The <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-big-apple" title="Big Apple definition"><span class="ndv">Big Apple</span></a>, as it is sometimes called, feels alive, fast and at the centre of everything, with lots of traffic, yellow taxis, theatres, and restaurants busy late into the night. The city offers enormous contrasts. Some of the most expensive homes in the world are in New York City, but on the streets outside are poor people without a home. It is possible to pay hundreds of dollars for a meal in a restaurant, or eat good, filling food for a few dollars from a street <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/vendor" title="vendor definition"><span class="ndv">vendor</span></a>.</span><span class="p">Many Americans have never been to New York, but everyone knows something about the city. They are familiar with the tall buildings of <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/manhattan#manhattan_2" title="Manhattan definition"><span class="ndv">Manhattan</span></a>, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/times-square" title="Times Square definition"><span class="ndv">Times Square</span></a> with its bright advertisements, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/madison-square-garden" title="Madison Square Garden definition"><span class="ndv">Madison Square Garden</span></a>, where many sports events take place, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/wall-street" title="Wall Street definition"><span class="ndv">Wall Street</span></a>, its financial heart, the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-empire-state-building#the_empire_state_building_topg_1" title="Empire State Building definition"><span class="ndv">Empire State Building</span></a>, the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-statue-of-liberty" title="Statue of Liberty definition"><span class="ndv">Statue of Liberty</span></a> and <span class="ndv" href="ellisisland_d_1" tofix="" xt="andv">Ellis Island</span>, where many of their <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/ancestor" title="ancestors definition"><span class="ndv">ancestors</span></a> first arrived in the US. There is also the World Trade Center Site (which was called <span class="ndv" href="groundzero_d_1" tofix="" xt="andv">Ground Zero</span> after the attacks of 9/11), where the development of the area is seen as a symbol of New Yorkers' courage and ability to recover after terrible events.</span><span class="p">New York was founded in 1624 by the Dutch, who called it <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/new-amsterdam" title="New Amsterdam definition"><span class="ndv">New Amsterdam</span></a>. Its Dutch origins can be seen in the names of old New York families like Stuyvesant and Vanderbilt, and in place names such as <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/brooklyn" title="Brooklyn definition"><span class="ndv">Brooklyn</span></a> (originally Breukelen) and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/harlem" title="Harlem definition"><span class="ndv">Harlem</span></a>. In 1664 the English gained control and changed the name to New York. In 1898 several towns were combined to make Greater New York City, which became the second largest city in the world, after London, though at the time part of it consisted of farms. Soon after, many new buildings were constructed, and in 1904 the New York <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/subway" title="subway definition"><span class="ndv">subway</span></a> was opened. The city is made up of five <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/borough" title="boroughs definition"><span class="ndv">boroughs</span></a>: The Bronx, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/brooklyn" title="Brooklyn definition"><span class="ndv">Brooklyn</span></a>, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/brooklyn" title="Manhattan definition"><span class="ndv">Manhattan</span></a>, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/queens" title="Queens definition"><span class="ndv">Queens</span></a>, and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/staten-island" title="Staten Island definition"><span class="ndv">Staten Island</span></a>.</span><span class="p">Many immigrants to the US stayed in New York, giving the city the variety of cultures it has today. During the 1920s, when alcohol was banned, New York had many <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/speakeasy" title="speakeasies definition"><span class="ndv">speakeasies</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= bars serving alcohol)</span>, which were illegal but very popular.

Some are not patient with visitors who are not used to the fast pace of the city. But for many visitors, meeting real New Yorkers is part of the attraction of going to the city.</span></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html>`;
