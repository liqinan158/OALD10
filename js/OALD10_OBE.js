Now more are given to members of the public suggested by colleagues and friends, or by people who admire their achievements. The <span class="eb">Ceremonial Secretariat</span> receives suggestions and draws up a final list, which is approved by the prime minister. As well as the names of politicians and business people, it contains charity workers, well-known sports and television personalities, actors, musicians, etc., and many ordinary people. Honours are awarded by the king or queen, or another member of the Royal Family, in a ceremony at <span class="ndv" href="buckinghampalace_d_1" tofix="" xt="andv">Buckingham Palace</span>.</span><span class="p">Many of the honours are associated with one of several <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/order-of-chivalry" title="orders of chivalry definition"><span class="ndv">orders of chivalry</span></a></span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= groups of successful and respected people)</span>.
