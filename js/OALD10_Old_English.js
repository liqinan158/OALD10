Saxon was the language spoken at the court of King <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/alfred-the-great" title="Alfred the Great definition"><span class="ndv">Alfred the Great</span></a>, who encouraged people to translate Latin books into English, and so it became the main language of literature.

Most of these are short religious writings or poems about great heroes. The most famous of these is <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/beowulf" title="Beowulf definition"><span class="ndv">Beowulf</span></a>, created by an unknown author and written down in the 8th or 9th century. <span class="ei">Beowulf</span> is set in 5th-century <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/scandinavia" title="Scandinavia definition"><span class="ndv">Scandinavia</span></a> and tells the story of the hero Beowulf's battles with the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/monster#monster_1" title="monster definition"><span class="ndv">monster</span></a> Grendel and Grendel's mother.</span><span class="p">To modern British people Old English looks at first like a foreign language. It was originally written in <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/rune" title="runes definition"><span class="ndv">runes</span></a></span> or <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/runic" title="runic definition"><span class="ndv">runic</span></a> letters</span>, an ancient <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/alphabet" title="alphabet definition"><span class="ndv">alphabet</span></a> of 24 <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/angular" title="angular definition"><span class="ndv">angular</span></a> letters, and then in a form of the Roman alphabet that included several of these letters, such as the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/thorn" title="thorn definition"><span class="ndv">thorn</span></a> (þ) for ‘th’, both voiced <span class="eph"><span class="wrap">/</span>ð<span class="wrap">/</span></span> and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/voiceless" title="voiceless definition"><span class="ndv">voiceless</span></a> <span class="eph"><span class="wrap">/</span>θ<span class="wrap">/</span></span>, and the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/ash#ash_1" title="ash definition"><span class="ndv">ash</span></a> (æ). Some Old English words, such as <span class="ei">dead</span>, <span class="ei">is</span>, <span class="ei">brother</span> and <span class="ei">and</span> in the following passage from Beowulf, have survived with little change into modern English. Some words become easier to recognize when they are translated, for example <span class="ei">yldra</span> meaning ‘older’ and <span class="ei">min</span> for ‘my’, whereas others are completely foreign to us. Word order is also different from modern English.</span><span class="blockquote"><span class="p-g"><span class="wrap_open">“</span><span class="p">Hroðgar maþelode, helm Scyldinga:</span><span class="p">‘Ne frin þu æfter sælum!
