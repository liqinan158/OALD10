Pronunciations given in most dictionaries are RP, or an adapted form of it.</span><span class="p">RP is a social accent not linked to any particular region of Britain, though it developed originally from the form of <span class="ndv" href="middleenglish_unbox_1" tofix="" xt="andv">Middle English</span> spoken around London. At that time London was the economic centre of England and the place where people were trained for professions such as the law. From the 15th century it became a centre for publishing. RP was the accent of upper-class people, and of the most highly educated people. The connection between RP and education was important in establishing the accent.</span><span class="p">People became increasingly conscious of accent and by the late 19th century it was considered necessary to adopt RP and lose any regional accent in order to have a successful career, especially in the army or government. RP was spread among children of the upper and upper middle classes through the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/public-school" title="public school definition"><span class="ndv">public school</span></a> system. Others took <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/elocution" title="elocution definition"><span class="ndv">elocution</span></a> lessons in order to learn to speak ‘properly’. Later, RP was taught in state schools. The public school accent and the <span class="eb">Oxford accent</span>, the accent adopted by some members of <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/oxford-university" title="Oxford University definition"><span class="ndv">Oxford University</span></a>, which many former public school pupils attended, are now considered by many to be rather artificial.</span><span class="p">The RP spoken by members of the upper class, including older members of the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-royal-family#the_royal_family_topg_1" title="royal family definition"><span class="ndv">royal family</span></a>, is called <span class="eb">advanced RP</span> or <span class="eb">marked RP</span>. Many people think that, like the Oxford accent, it doesn't sound natural. It may be described as ‘ <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/clipped" title="clipped definition"><span class="ndv">clipped</span></a> ’ if it is spoken with a tight mouth, or ‘ <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/plummy" title="plummy definition"><span class="ndv">plummy</span></a> ’ if it sounds as though the speaker had a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/plum#plum_1" title="plum definition"><span class="ndv">plum</span></a> in his or her mouth. Marked RP has particular vowel sounds, for example the ‘a’ in <span class="ei">sat</span> sounds more like the ‘e’ in <span class="ei">set</span>, the short ‘o’ in <span class="ei">cost</span> sounds like the long ‘o’ in <span class="ei">for</span>, and <span class="ei">really</span> sounds more like <span class="ei">rarely</span>.</span><span class="p">The status of RP became stronger in the 1920s after the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/bbc" title="BBC definition"><span class="ndv">BBC</span></a> began radio broadcasts. For a long time <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/announcer" title="announcers definition"><span class="ndv">announcers</span></a> spoke with RP accents, and the accent became known as the <span class="eb">BBC accent</span>. Standard English, the form of English grammar considered correct, is, when spoken with an RP accent, sometimes called <span class="eb">BBC English</span>, <span class="eb">Oxford English</span>, or <span class="eb">the Queen's/​King's English</span>.</span><span class="p">Today the BBC uses many announcers with regional accents. As a result there is now a much greater acceptance of non-RP accents. Many people now speak a modified form of RP with some regional characteristics.</span></span></span></div><div class="collapse" hclass="collapse" htag="div"><span class="unbox" id="rp_unbox_2" unbox="snippet"><span class="box_title" onclick="toggle_active(this)">Oxford Collocations Dictionary</span><span class="body"><span class="p"><span class="eb">RP</span> is used before these nouns: <ul class="collocs_list"><li bord="n" class="li">accent</li></ul></span><span class="xref_to_full_entry">See <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/collocations/rp" title=" definition in Collocations">full entry</a></span></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_rp__gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_rp__gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_rp__us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_rp__us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
