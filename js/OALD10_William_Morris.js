As an artist and poet he was influenced by the <span class="ndv" href="pre_raphaelite_topg_1" tofix="" xt="andv">Pre-Raphaelites</span> but he is best known as a designer of furniture and decoration for houses. He disliked the mass production methods of his time and wanted the role of the traditional <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/craftsman" title="craftsman definition"><span class="ndv">craftsman</span></a> to continue. He established his own company which produced <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/handmade" title="handmade definition"><span class="ndv">handmade</span></a> furniture and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/interior#interior_1" title="interior definition"><span class="ndv">interior</span></a> decoration using traditional methods.

As one of the early socialists in Britain, Morris was a supporter of social change and formed his own Socialist League in 1884. He led his own campaigns on the streets against what he saw as the terrible effects of the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-industrial-revolution" title="Industrial Revolution definition"><span class="ndv">Industrial Revolution</span></a> on workers.</span></span></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_william_morris_1_gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_william_morris_1_gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_william_morris_1_us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_william_morris_1_us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
