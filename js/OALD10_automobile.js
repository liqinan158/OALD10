Almost everybody over the age of 15 is a driver and most households have a vehicle. American life is arranged so that people can do many things from their cars. There are <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/drive-in#drivein_sng_2" title="drive-in definition"><span class="ndv">drive-in</span></a></span> banks, post offices, restaurants, movie theatres and even some churches.</span><span class="p">In Britain the percentage of the population who are drivers is slightly less but, as in the US, many people prefer to use their car rather than public transport, because it is more convenient and because they like to be independent. In order to reduce pollution, the government tries to encourage people to use other forms of transport by making driving expensive. In particular, it puts a heavy tax on fuel and increases the annual <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/road-tax" title="road tax definition"><span class="ndv">road tax</span></a></span> for cars that cause heavy pollution. <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/congestion-charging" title="Congestion charging definition"><span class="ndv">Congestion charging</span></a> is used to persuade people to avoid driving their cars in some city centres.</span><span class="p">To some people the make and quality of their car reflects their status in society, and it is important to them to get a smart new car every few years. In Britain since 2001 the <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/registration-number" title="registration number definition"><span class="ndv">registration number</span></a></span> of a car shows the place and date of <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/registration#registration_sng_1" title="registration definition"><span class="ndv">registration</span></a> but older <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/number-plate" title="number plates definition"><span class="ndv">number plates</span></a></span> can be used and a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/personalized" title="personalized definition"><span class="ndv">personalized</span></a> number plate</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= a plate that spells out the owner's name or initials)</span> may also suggest status. Many people prefer to buy a small, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/economical#economical_sng_1" title="economical definition"><span class="ndv">economical</span></a> car, or get a second-hand one. Cars in the US are often larger than those in Britain and though fuel is cheaper, insurance is expensive. In the US car <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/license-plate" title="license plates definition"><span class="ndv">license plates</span></a></span>, commonly called <span class="eb">tags</span>, are given by the states. New ones must be bought when a driver moves to another state. The states use the plates to advertise themselves: <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/alabama" title="Alabama definition"><span class="ndv">Alabama</span></a> plates say ‘Heart of Dixie’ and have a small heart on them, and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/illinois" title="Illinois definition"><span class="ndv">Illinois</span></a> has ‘Land of Lincoln’.</span><span class="p">In Britain, before a person can get a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/driving-licence" title="driving licence definition"><span class="ndv">driving licence</span></a></span> they must pass an official <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/driving-test" title="driving test definition"><span class="ndv">driving test</span></a></span>, which includes a written test on a computer of the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-highway-code" title="Highway Code definition"><span class="ndv">Highway Code</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= the rules that all road users must obey)</span> and a practical driving exam. Only people aged 17 or over are allowed to drive. <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/learner-driver" title="Learner drivers definition"><span class="ndv">Learner drivers</span></a></span> who have a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/provisional-licence" title="provisional licence definition"><span class="ndv">provisional licence</span></a></span> must display an <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/l-plate" title="L-plate definition"><span class="ndv">L-plate</span></a></span>, a large red ‘L’, on their car, and be <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/supervise" title="supervised definition"><span class="ndv">supervised</span></a> by a qualified driver. The US has no national <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/driver-s-license" title="driver's license definition"><span class="ndv">driver's license</span></a></span> (<span class="ei">NAmE</span>), but instead licenses are issued by each state. Most require written tests, an eye test and a short practical test. The minimum age for getting a license is normally 16, although some states will issue a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/learner-s-permit" title="learner's permit definition"><span class="ndv">learner's permit</span></a></span> to drivers as young as 14. Many states now apply a system of <span class="eb">graduated licenses</span> in which young drivers are first required to have an <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/intermediate#intermediate_1" title="intermediate definition"><span class="ndv">intermediate</span></a> license</span> for a period of time before being given a <span class="eb">full license</span>. An <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/intermediate#intermediate_sng_2" title="intermediate definition"><span class="ndv">intermediate</span></a> license may, for example, prevent driving alone at particular times of the day or require the driver to take special classes if they drive badly. Americans have to get a new driver's license if they move to another state. In both Britain and the US drivers need a special licence to drive certain types of vehicle, for example a bus, lorry or motorcycle. </span><span class="p">In Britain people drive on the left and in the US they drive on the right. Generally British and US drivers are relatively careful and polite but there is dangerous driving. In the US many of the deaths due to <span class="eb">traffic accidents</span> are caused by drivers who have drunk alcohol. <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/drink-driving" title="Drink-driving definition"><span class="ndv">Drink-driving</span></a></span> (<span class="ei">NAmE</span> <span class="eb">drunk driving</span>, <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/driving-under-the-influence" title="driving under the influence definition"><span class="ndv">driving under the influence</span></a></span> or <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/driving-while-intoxicated" title="driving while intoxicated definition"><span class="ndv">driving while intoxicated</span></a></span>) <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= driving a car after drinking alcohol)</span> is also a serious problem in Britain.
