The words used often lose their normal meaning and act simply as a way of expressing feelings. Swear words are usually short and have a strong sound. Since many swear words have four letters they are sometimes called <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/four-letter-word" title="four-letter words definition"><span class="ndv">four-letter words</span></a></span>.</span><span class="p">Like slang expressions, swear words come in and out of fashion and over time often lose their power to shock. They are replaced by new, stronger words, though the old-fashioned words may continue to be used by older people. <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/exclamation" title="Exclamations definition"><span class="ndv">Exclamations</span></a> such as <span class="ei">Drat!</span>, <span class="ei">Blow!</span> and <span class="ei">Blast!</span>, for instance, are now rarely heard among young people, although the older generation still use them.</span><span class="p">Swear words are also called <span class="eb">bad language</span> and swear words that refer to sex or to functions of the body are called <span class="eb">dirty words</span> or <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/obscene" title="obscene definition"><span class="ndv">obscene</span></a> language</span>. Other swear words have a religious origin and are sometimes called <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/oath" title="oaths definition"><span class="ndv">oaths</span></a></span>. Often, obscene and religious language are combined, as in the expression <span class="ei">Fucking hell!</span> A person who is very angry and using a lot of swear words may be said to be <span class="eb"><span class="ndv" href="curse_subentryg_2:curse_topg_3" tofix="">cursing</span> and swearing</span> or <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/blind#eff_idmg_2" title="effing and blinding definition"><span class="ndv">effing and blinding</span></a></span> (<span class="ei">BrE</span>).</span><span class="p">The most common oaths include <span class="ei">Damn!</span>, <span class="ei">God!</span>, <span class="ei">Christ!</span>, <span class="ei">Jesus Christ!</span> and <span class="ei">For Chrissake!</span>, which may cause offence to Christians. The strongest swear words include <span class="ei">Fuck!</span> and <span class="ei">Shit!</span> Other things people say when they are angry or annoyed are <span class="ei">Bugger!</span>(<span class="ei">BrE</span>), <span class="ei">Dang!</span> (<span class="ei">NAmE</span>) , <span class="ei">Darn!</span> (<span class="ei">NAmE</span>) and <span class="ei">Crap!</span> (<span class="ei">NAmE</span>). Swear words used to <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/insult#insult_1" title="insult definition"><span class="ndv">insult</span></a> people include <span class="ei">Bastard!</span>, <span class="ei">Bitch!</span>, <span class="ei">Arsehole!</span> (<span class="ei">BrE</span>), <span class="ei">Asshole!</span> (<span class="ei">NAmE</span>) and, especially in the US, <span class="ei">Son of a bitch!</span> and <span class="ei">Motherfucker!</span>. <span class="ei">Cunt!</span> is a particularly offensive insult. </span><span class="p">Expressions with 'it' added such as in <span class="ei">Damn it!</span> and <span class="ei">Fuck it!</span> are used as alternatives to the single word. When 'off' is added, as in <span class="ei">Fuck off!</span> and <span class="ei">Piss off!</span>, the expressions take on the meaning of 'Go away!' <span class="ei">Eff off!</span> is used to mean 'fuck off' without actually saying the word. It is still offensive.</span><span class="p">The words <span class="ei">frigging</span>, <span class="ei">chuffing</span> (<span class="ei">BrE</span>) and <span class="ei">freaking</span> (<span class="ei">NAmE</span>), and the stronger <span class="ei">fucking</span> are used to make the meaning stronger in expressions like <span class="ei">You're a freaking liar!</span> and <span class="ei">Fucking hell!</span>. <span class="ei">Damn</span>, and the stronger <span class="ei">bloody</span> (<span class="ei">BrE</span>), are used before nouns, as in <span class="ei">a damn nuisance</span> and <span class="ei">You bloody fool!</span></span><span class="p">Some people feel strongly that it is always wrong to swear and do not like to hear others swearing. The angrier the tone of voice, the more unpleasant it is likely to be. Other people swear only when a situation makes them very upset. But some people use swear words in almost every sentence. People may apologize if they use a swear word in front of somebody who does not approve of swearing, possibly by saying ' <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/excuse#french_idmg_3" title="Excuse/​Pardon my French definition"><span class="ndv">Excuse/​Pardon my French</span></a>'. Some people may use an ordinary word or a mild swear word in place of the stronger one they would really like to say. People may say <span class="ei">Sugar!</span>, for example, instead of <span class="ei">Shit!</span>, though this is now rather old-fashioned. Children are usually not allowed by their parents to swear, and so often find these words especially interesting.</span><span class="p">When strong swear words are spoken on television they may be <span class="eb">bleeped out</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= replaced by a short high noise)</span> to avoid causing offence. Some words may not be used during times when children might hear them.
