They are danced to folk tunes and have sequences of <span class="eb">steps</span> that are repeated several times. Dances are performed by pairs of dancers often arranged in <span class="eb">sets</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= groups of six or eight people)</span>. Dancers move up and down the set and change partners. The dancing is often very fast. A <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/caller" title="caller definition"><span class="ndv">caller</span></a></span> usually <span class="eb">calls</span> the steps during the dance. In England folk dances are now danced mainly by people who belong to a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/country-dancing" title="country dancing definition"><span class="ndv">country dancing</span></a></span> club, or at <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/barn-dance" title="barn dances definition"><span class="ndv">barn dances</span></a></span> held in a village hall.</span><span class="p">Many English villages have <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/morris-dancing" title="morris dancing definition"><span class="ndv">morris dancing</span></a> teams. Morris dancing is usually performed on <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/village-green#village_green_topg_1" title="village greens definition"><span class="ndv">village greens</span></a> or outside country pubs on <span class="ndv" href="mayday_d_1" tofix="" xt="andv">May Day</span> and throughout the summer. The dancers dress in white and wear sets of small bells at the knee. Dances consist of a series of jumps and <span class="ndv" href="hop_subentryg_1:hop_topg_2" tofix="">hops</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= jumps on one leg)</span>. As they dance the dancers often wave <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/handkerchief" title="handkerchiefs definition"><span class="ndv">handkerchiefs</span></a> in the air. In some dances they carry a stick which they strike against that of their partner. Themes of the dances include death and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/rebirth" title="rebirth definition"><span class="ndv">rebirth</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= new life)</span> in nature. In some dances <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/mythological" title="mythological definition"><span class="ndv">mythological</span></a> characters like the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/green-man" title="Green Man definition"><span class="ndv">Green Man</span></a> appear. Sometimes dancers paint their faces black, perhaps reflecting the possible origin of Morris dancing in <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/moorish" title="Moorish definition"><span class="ndv">Moorish</span></a> dance.

Children often take part. Each dancer holds the end of a long <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/ribbon" title="ribbon definition"><span class="ndv">ribbon</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= narrow piece of cloth)</span>, which is attached to the top of a maypole painted in bright colours. The ribbons are <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/woven" title="woven definition"><span class="ndv">woven</span></a> round the maypole as the dancers dance round each other. Some towns have their own folk dance: for example, the <span class="eb">Furry Dance</span>, or <span class="eb">Floral Dance</span>, is danced through the streets of Helston in <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/cornwall" title="Cornwall definition"><span class="ndv">Cornwall</span></a>.</span><span class="p">Scottish dances are usually danced to the music of the <span class="ndv" href="bagpipes_d_1" tofix="" xt="andv">bagpipes</span> or a fiddle at a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/ceilidh" title="ceilidh definition"><span class="ndv">ceilidh</span></a></span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= an evening of dancing, music and, in the past, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/storytelling" title="storytelling definition"><span class="ndv">storytelling</span></a>)</span>. A traditional ceilidh is performed in Scottish national dress, with men wearing <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/kilt" title="kilts definition"><span class="ndv">kilts</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= skirts with folds that reach to the knees)</span> and women in plain dresses. Some people go to <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/scottish-country-dancing" title="Scottish country dancing definition"><span class="ndv">Scottish country dancing</span></a></span> classes as a hobby. The best-known Scottish dance is the <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/highland-fling" title="Highland fling definition"><span class="ndv">Highland fling</span></a></span>, which is usually performed by one dancer alone. The <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/sword-dance" title="sword dance definition"><span class="ndv">sword dance</span></a></span> is performed by one or two dancers over two crossed swords. Popular dances for groups of people are the <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-gay-gordons" title="Gay Gordons definition"><span class="ndv">Gay Gordons</span></a></span> and the <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/eightsome" title="Eightsome definition"><span class="ndv">Eightsome</span></a></span>.</span><span class="p">Ireland has a similar ceilidh tradition. In <span class="eb">Irish dancing</span> the dancers do not move the upper part of their body. Since the late 20th century there has been greater interest in Irish folk dancing resulting from the success of stage shows like <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/riverdance" title="Riverdance definition"><span class="ndv">Riverdance</span></a>. In Irish <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/clog-dance" title="clog dancing definition"><span class="ndv">clog dancing</span></a></span>, the dancers wear <span class="ndv" href="clog_subentryg_1:clog_topg_2" tofix="">clogs</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= heavy wooden shoes)</span> with which they strike the floor.</span><span class="p"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/line-dancing" title="Line dancing definition"><span class="ndv">Line dancing</span></a>, which comes from the US, is also popular in Britain. In the US itself there are folk dances from many different countries, brought by people when they settled there. But the best-known kind of folk dancing is <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/square-dance" title="square dancing definition"><span class="ndv">square dancing</span></a></span>, which has its origins in various dances from Britain. Square dancing was an important part of social life in the days when people were moving west. On Saturday evenings people would gather in a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/barn" title="barn definition"><span class="ndv">barn</span></a> for a dance. As in English country dancing there was a caller, and the dancers danced to the music of a fiddle. Most square dances start and finish with couples standing in a square, but some, like the <span class="eb">Virginia Reel</span>, involve people standing in two lines. American children still learn square dancing, but very few adults now do it.</span></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_barn_dance_1_gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_barn_dance_1_gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_barn_dance_1_us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_barn_dance_1_us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
