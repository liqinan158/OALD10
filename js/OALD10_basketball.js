It was invented in 1891 in <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/springfield" title="Springfield definition"><span class="ndv">Springfield</span></a>, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/massachusetts" title="Massachusetts definition"><span class="ndv">Massachusetts</span></a>, by Dr James Naismith.

The first professional organization for male players was established in 1898, and the <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/nba" title="NBA definition"><span class="ndv">NBA</span></a></span> (<span class="eb">National Basketball Association</span>) was set up in 1949. Games are now played by basketball stars before huge audiences. The team seen most outside the US is the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-harlem-globetrotters#the_harlem_globetrotters_topg_1" title="Harlem Globetrotters definition"><span class="ndv">Harlem Globetrotters</span></a>. It is mainly an indoor sport but it is also played with just as much enthusiasm by young people on the streets of US cities.</span><span class="p">Basketball is played by two teams of five players, but seven other players can be brought on to replace them during the game. The <span class="eb">court</span> is up to 94 feet/29.7 metres long and 50 feet/15 metres wide. At each end is a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/hoop" title="hoop definition"><span class="ndv">hoop</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= a metal ring)</span> 10 feet/3 metres above the floor. The hoop is attached to a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/backboard" title="backboard definition"><span class="ndv">backboard</span></a> and has a net without a bottom hanging from it. Players score two points when they throw the ball through the hoop from an area near the basket, and three points if they are further away. The team that scores the most points wins. The most exciting score is a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/slam-dunk#slam-dunk_1" title="slam dunk definition"><span class="ndv">slam dunk</span></a></span> when a tall player jumps up high and pushes the ball down through the hoop. The ball is moved between players by a <span class="eb">pass</span>, or a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/dribble#dribble_1" title="dribble definition"><span class="ndv">dribble</span></a></span> if a player <span class="ndv" href="bounce_subentryg_1:bounce_topg_2" tofix="">bounces</span> it on the floor.

The season ends when the best eight teams in each of the two leagues, the <span class="eb">Eastern Conference</span> and the <span class="eb">Western Conference</span> compete to play in the <span class="eb">NBA Championship</span>. Women players take part in <span class="eb">Women's National Basketball Association</span> league.

But the sport receives less attention than in the US and, in contrast to the names of teams and players in football, the names of the leading basketball teams and players are unknown to most people.</span></span></span></div><span class="topic-g"><span class="prefix">Topics </span><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/topic/sports-ball-and-racket-sports?level=a2" title="Topic sports-ball-and-racket-sports"><span class="topic" href="l2:sport:sports_ball_and_racket_sports?cefr=a2"><span class="topic_name">Sports: ball and racket sports</span><span class="topic_cefr">a2</span></span></a></span><div class="collapse" hclass="collapse" htag="div"><span class="unbox" id="basketball_unbox_2" unbox="snippet"><span class="box_title" onclick="toggle_active(this)">Oxford Collocations Dictionary</span><span class="body"><span class="unbox">adjective</span><ul class="collocs_list"><li class="li">college</li><li class="li">high-school</li><li class="li">pro</li><li class="li">…</li></ul><span class="unbox">… of basketball</span><ul class="collocs_list"><li class="li">game</li></ul><span class="unbox">verb + basketball</span><ul class="collocs_list"><li class="li">play</li><li class="li">watch</li></ul><span class="unbox">basketball + noun</span><ul class="collocs_list"><li class="li">championship</li><li class="li">competition</li><li class="li">game</li><li class="li">…</li></ul><span class="xref_to_full_entry">See <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/collocations/basketball" title=" definition in Collocations">full entry</a></span></span></span></div> </li><li cefr="a2" class="sense" hclass="sense" htag="li" id="basketball_sng_2" sensenum="2"><span class="sensetop" hclass="sensetop" htag="span"><span class="grammar" hclass="grammar" htag="span">[countable]</span></span> <span class="def" hclass="def" htag="span">the ball used in this game</span><ul class="examples" hclass="examples" htag="ul"><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_basketball__4"><span class="x">to dribble/dunk a basketball</span></li></ul><span class="topic-g"><span class="prefix">Topics </span><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/topic/sports-ball-and-racket-sports?level=a2" title="Topic sports-ball-and-racket-sports"><span class="topic" href="l2:sport:sports_ball_and_racket_sports?cefr=a2"><span class="topic_name">Sports: ball and racket sports</span><span class="topic_cefr">a2</span></span></a></span> </li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_basketball__gb_2" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_basketball__gb_2.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_basketball__us_2" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_basketball__us_2.mp3"></audio>`;
