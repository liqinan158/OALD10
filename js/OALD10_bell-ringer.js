In Britain the sound of church bells from a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/belfry" title="belfry definition"><span class="ndv">belfry</span></a></span> is associated with Sunday mornings and with weddings. Bells throughout the country may also be rung at times of national celebration. Before minor services or to announce a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/funeral" title="funeral definition"><span class="ndv">funeral</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= a service for a dead person)</span>, a single bell is usually sounded for five or ten minutes.

The ringers stand far below the bells and each pulls on a long rope attached to a bell in such a way that the bell <span class="ndv" href="swing_subentryg_1:swing_topg_2" tofix="">swings</span> over in a circle, causing the <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/clapper" title="clapper definition"><span class="ndv">clapper</span></a></span> inside the bell to strike the side. In a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/peal#peal_1" title="peal definition"><span class="ndv">peal</span></a></span>, each of the bells is rung in turn, and the order in which they are rung changes according to a pattern. This is called <span class="eb">change-ringing</span>. Complicated tunes can be played and many <span class="eb">changes</span> have their own name, for example <span class="ebi">Grandsire Triples</span> and <span class="ebi">Oxford Treble Bob</span>.</span><span class="p">Other types of institution also use bells: Great Tom, the big bell at Christ Church College, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/oxford#oxford_2" title="Oxford definition"><span class="ndv">Oxford</span></a>, is rung 101 times each night, indicating the original number of <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/scholar" title="scholars definition"><span class="ndv">scholars</span></a> at the college.

Bells are heard in churches and at colleges and universities. Some communities, especially in <span class="ndv" href="newengland_d_1" tofix="" xt="andv">New England</span>, ring bells as a celebration. Bells are also used to announce the time, mostly using the eight notes of Big Ben.</span><span class="p">There are very few traditional bell-ringers in the US. Instead, many institutions have <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/carillon" title="carillon definition"><span class="ndv">carillon</span></a> bells</span>, <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= a group of up to 70 bells controlled from a keyboard like that of an organ)</span> which can play tunes.
