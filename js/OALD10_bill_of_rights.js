All of the amendments were agreed in 1791, two years after the Constitution began to be used. They give Americans rights which are now considered basic, but which were unusual at the time. The government cannot limit these rights.</span><span class="p">Some of the amendments apply to all Americans. The <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-first-amendment" title="First Amendment definition"><span class="ndv">First Amendment</span></a> promises <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/freedom-of-religion" title="freedom of religion definition"><span class="ndv">freedom of religion</span></a></span> and also <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/freedom-of-speech" title="freedom of speech definition"><span class="ndv">freedom of speech</span></a></span> and <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/freedom-of-the-press" title="freedom of the press definition"><span class="ndv">freedom of the press</span></a></span>, which means that ordinary people and journalists can speak or write what they want, without being limited by the government. The <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-second-amendment" title="Second Amendment definition"><span class="ndv">Second Amendment</span></a>, which gives people the right to own guns, is now the subject of much debate. The Fourth Amendment says that people cannot be arrested and their houses may not be searched, unless the police have a good reason for doing so. The Ninth and Tenth Amendments say that people and states have other rights in addition to those mentioned in the Constitution, but that the US government has only the powers that are listed there.</span><span class="p">Other amendments give rights to people who are accused of a crime. The <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-fifth-amendment" title="Fifth Amendment definition"><span class="ndv">Fifth Amendment</span></a> says that people do not have to give evidence against themselves. Somebody who wants to use this right says, ‘ <span class="eb">I plead the Fifth</span> ’ or ‘ <span class="eb">I take the Fifth</span> ’, and this is often thought to mean that they are afraid to answer questions in case they get into trouble. The Sixth Amendment promises that people who have been accused of a crime will get a trial quickly. In fact, US courts are so busy that people often have to wait a long time, but the government cannot make them wait longer than necessary. The Seventh Amendment gives people who are accused of a serious crime the right to have their case heard by a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/jury" title="jury definition"><span class="ndv">jury</span></a>, so that ordinary citizens, not just a judge, decide whether they are innocent or guilty. The Eighth Amendment says that people who are found guilty of a crime cannot be given ‘cruel and unusual punishments’. There has been a lot of discussion about exactly what this means. This amendment was once used as an argument against <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/capital-punishment#capitalpunishment_sng_1" title="capital punishment definition"><span class="ndv">capital punishment</span></a> but it was decided later that the death sentence was not a cruel and unusual punishment.</span><span class="p">In Britain the Bill of Rights is the informal name of the Act Declaring the Rights and Liberties of the Subject, which was passed by Parliament in 1689. This Act dealt mainly with the relationship between the king or queen and Parliament. The earlier Declaration of Right had already reduced the power of the king or queen, and the new Act helped make Britain a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/constitutional-monarchy" title="constitutional monarchy definition"><span class="ndv">constitutional monarchy</span></a>, in which real power lies with Parliament, not with the king or queen. The Act also prevented a <span class="ndv" href="romancatholic_d_1" tofix="" xt="andv">Roman Catholic</span> from becoming king or queen.</span></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_bill_of_rights_1_gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_bill_of_rights_1_gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_bill_of_rights_1_us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_bill_of_rights_1_us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
