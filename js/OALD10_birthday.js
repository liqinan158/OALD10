onclick="toggle_active(this)">Culture <span class="closed">birthdays</span></span><span class="body"><span class="unbox">birthdays</span><span class="p">Birthdays are especially important to the very young and the very old. On their birthday, people receive <span class="eb">birthday cards</span> and <span class="eb">birthday presents</span> from their family and friends. Children's cards often have a large number on them showing how old they are. Cards for adults have pictures of flowers or countryside, or humorous or rude cartoons. Cards for <span class="eb">significant</span> birthdays, such as 18, 40 or 60 may also have a large number on them. Inside the cards, there is often a simple greeting, such as ‘Happy Birthday’ or ‘Many Happy Returns of the Day’, or there may be a longer message or poem. Children expect to receive a special birthday present from their parents.</span><span class="p">Many younger children invite their friends to a <span class="eb">birthday party</span> at their home. <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/balloon#balloon_1" title="Balloons definition"><span class="ndv">Balloons</span></a> are often tied to the gate of the house where the party is being held. Children wear their <span class="eb">party clothes</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= best clothes)</span> and take a present. They play <span class="eb">party games</span> such as ‘pin the tail on the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/donkey" title="donkey definition"><span class="ndv">donkey</span></a> ’ or ‘musical chairs’. Sometimes parents arrange for an <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/entertainer" title="entertainer definition"><span class="ndv">entertainer</span></a> such as a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/magician" title="magician definition"><span class="ndv">magician</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= a person who does magic tricks)</span> to visit the house, or they organize a celebration at a restaurant, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/leisure-centre" title="leisure centre definition"><span class="ndv">leisure centre</span></a>, etc. After the games there is a special tea with a <span class="eb">birthday cake</span>. The cake is covered with sugar icing (<span class="ei">NAmE</span> <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/frosting" title="frosting definition"><span class="ndv">frosting</span></a>), and has small <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/candle" title="candles definition"><span class="ndv">candles</span></a> on top, the same number of candles as the child's age. As the cake is carried into the room with the candles lit, everyone sings ‘<span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/happy-birthday-to-you" title="Happy Birthday To You! definition"><span class="ndv">Happy Birthday To You!</span></a></span>’ and then the <span class="eb">birthday boy</span> or <span class="eb">birthday girl</span> tries to blow out all the candles with one breath and makes a secret wish.</span><span class="p">In the US, the 16th birthday for girls is sometimes called <span class="eb">sweet sixteen</span>. In many states 16 is the age at which a person can get a US driver's licence, and some wealthier parents give their children a car as a present. At 18, in Britain and in the US, young people become adults and many have a big party. In most parts of the US, 21 is the age at which people are allowed by law to drink alcohol. In Britain people celebrate 21st birthdays less than when 21 was the age at which they became adults.</span><span class="p">Many adults dislike getting older and a few lie about their age, saying they are younger than they really are. But in general older people are now much more willing to tell others their age. You may see a sign by the side of a road saying, for example: ‘Dave Ellis 50 today!’, put there by Dave's friends. It is quite common for friends and family to organize a surprise party for an adult's birthday, where the guests gather secretly and surpise the person whose birthday it is when they are brought into the room. Few people live to be 100, so a 100th birthday is very special. In Britain people reaching this age may receive a card containing a printed message from the Queen.</span></span></span></div><div class="collapse" hclass="collapse" htag="div"><span class="unbox" id="birthday_unbox_3" unbox="extra_examples"><span class="box_title" onclick="toggle_active(this)">Extra Examples</span><ul class="examples" hclass="examples" htag="ul"><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_birthday__7"><span class="unx">My birthday is in August.</span></li><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_birthday__8"><span class="unx">I hope you have a nice birthday.</span></li><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_birthday__9"><span class="unx">Wish John a happy birthday from me.</span></li><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_birthday__10"><span class="unx">I reached my 86th birthday this year.</span></li><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_birthday__11"><span class="unx">I'll be 28 next birthday.</span></li><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_birthday__12"><span class="unx">She spent her 50th birthday in Paris.</span></li><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_birthday__13"><span class="unx">Three of my friends have birthdays this month.</span></li><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_birthday__14"><span class="unx">They share the same birthday.</span></li><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_birthday__15"><span class="unx">What do you want for your birthday?</span></li><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_birthday__16"><span class="unx">an exhibition to mark the artist's 70th birthday</span></li><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_birthday__17"><span class="unx">We're taking him to see the new film for his birthday treat.</span></li><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_birthday__18"><span class="unx">He had a portrait painted as a birthday surprise for his daughter.</span></li></ul></span></div><span class="topic-g"><span class="prefix">Topics </span><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/topic/religion-and-festivals?level=a1" title="Topic religion-and-festivals"><span class="topic" href="l2:politics_and_society:religion_and_festivals?cefr=a1"><span class="topic_name">Religion and festivals</span><span class="topic_cefr">a1</span></span></a></span><div class="collapse" hclass="collapse" htag="div"><span class="unbox" id="birthday_unbox_4" unbox="snippet"><span class="box_title" onclick="toggle_active(this)">Oxford Collocations Dictionary</span><span class="body"><span class="unbox">adjective</span><ul class="collocs_list"><li class="li">last</li><li class="li">next</li></ul><span class="unbox">verb + birthday</span><ul class="collocs_list"><li class="li">have</li><li class="li">spend</li><li class="li">celebrate</li><li class="li">…</li></ul><span class="unbox">birthday + noun</span><ul class="collocs_list"><li class="li">gift</li><li class="li">present</li><li class="li">card</li><li class="li">…</li></ul><span class="unbox">preposition</span><ul class="collocs_list"><li class="li">for your birthday</li><li class="li">on your birthday</li></ul><span class="unbox">phrases</span><ul class="collocs_list"><li class="li">happy birthday!</li><li class="li">wish somebody a happy birthday</li></ul><span class="xref_to_full_entry">See <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/collocations/birthday" title=" definition in Collocations">full entry</a></span></span></span></div> </li></ol><div class="idioms" hclass="idioms" htag="div" id="birthday_idmgs_1"><span class="idioms_heading">Idioms</span> <span class="idm-g" id="birthday_idmg_1" sk="inbirthdaysuit"><div class="top-container"><div class="top-g" id="birthday_topg_2"><div class="webtop"><span class="idm" id="birthday_idm_1">in your birthday suit</span> </div></div></div><ol class="sense_single" htag="ol"><li class="sense" hclass="sense" htag="li" id="birthday_sng_2"><span class="sensetop" hclass="sensetop" htag="span"><span class="labels" hclass="labels" htag="span">(humorous)</span></span> <span class="def" hclass="def" htag="span">not wearing any clothes</span> </li></ol></span></div></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_birthday__gb_3" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_birthday__gb_3.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_birthday__us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_birthday__us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
