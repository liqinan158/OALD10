Three main types of angling take place: <span class="eb"><span class="ndv" href="flyfishing_d_1" tofix="" xt="andv">fly fishing</span></span>, <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/coarse-fishing" title="coarse fishing definition"><span class="ndv">coarse fishing</span></a></span> and <span class="eb">sea fishing</span>.

This is mainly because of two strong traditions: the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/constitution" title="Constitution definition"><span class="ndv">Constitution</span></a> gives all Americans the right to own guns, and Americans have always hunted animals for food.

For these reasons, hunting is a sport for all classes and many people own <span class="eb">hunting <span class="ndv" href="rifle_subentryg_1:rifle_topg_2" tofix="">rifles</span></span>. Americans do not use the name <span class="ei">field sports</span>.
