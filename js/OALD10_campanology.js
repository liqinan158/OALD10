In Britain the sound of church bells from a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/belfry" title="belfry definition"><span class="ndv">belfry</span></a></span> is associated with Sunday mornings and with weddings. Bells throughout the country may also be rung at times of national celebration.

The ringers stand far below the bells and each pulls on a long rope attached to a bell in such a way that the bell <span class="ndv" href="swing_subentryg_1:swing_topg_2" tofix="">swings</span> over in a circle, causing the <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/clapper" title="clapper definition"><span class="ndv">clapper</span></a></span> inside the bell to strike the side. In a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/peal#peal_1" title="peal definition"><span class="ndv">peal</span></a></span>, each of the bells is rung in turn, and the order in which they are rung changes according to a pattern. This is called <span class="eb">change-ringing</span>. Complicated tunes can be played and many <span class="eb">changes</span> have their own name, for example <span class="ebi">Grandsire Triples</span> and <span class="ebi">Oxford Treble Bob</span>.</span><span class="p">Other types of institution also use bells: Great Tom, the big bell at Christ Church College, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/oxford#oxford_2" title="Oxford definition"><span class="ndv">Oxford</span></a>, is rung 101 times each night, indicating the original number of <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/scholar" title="scholars definition"><span class="ndv">scholars</span></a> at the college.
