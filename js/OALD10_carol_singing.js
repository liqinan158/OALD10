Many of them celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ.</span><span class="p">Carols were first sung in the 14th century. They were popular songs with a lively tune, and contained references to the celebrations and positive feelings associated with Christmas, as well as to Christ's birth. One of the oldest printed carols, dating from 1521, is the <span class="ebi">Boar's Head Carol</span>, which was sung in Queen's College, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/oxford#oxford_2" title="Oxford definition"><span class="ndv">Oxford</span></a> as Christmas lunch was carried in.
