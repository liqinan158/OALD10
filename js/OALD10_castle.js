When built, they were solid buildings with few comforts, designed for the defence of a town or region. About 1 200 castles were built in the 11th and 12th centuries, but the grandest were built when <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/edward-i#edward_i_topg_1" title="Edward I definition"><span class="ndv">Edward I</span></a> was king (1272–1307).
