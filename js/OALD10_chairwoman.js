Some people may be very offended if you do not.</li></ul><span class="unbox">The human race</span><ul class="bullet"><li class="li"><span class="eb">Man</span> and <span class="eb">mankind</span> have traditionally been used to mean ‘all men and women’. Many people now prefer to use <span class="eb">humanity</span>, <span class="eb">the human race</span>, <span class="eb">human beings</span> or <span class="eb">people</span>.</li></ul><span class="unbox">Jobs</span><ul class="bullet"><li class="li">The suffix <span class="eb">-ess</span> in names of occupations such as <span class="eb">actress</span>, <span class="eb">hostess</span> and <span class="eb">waitress</span> shows that the person doing the job is a woman. Many people now avoid these. Instead you can use <span class="eb">actor</span> or <span class="eb">host</span> (although <span class="eb">actress</span> and <span class="eb">hostess</span> are still very common), or a neutral word, such as <span class="eb">server</span> for <span class="ei">waiter</span> and <span class="ei">waitress</span>.</li><li class="li">Neutral words like <span class="eb">assistant</span>, <span class="eb">worker</span>, <span class="eb">person</span> or <span class="eb">officer</span> are now often used instead of <span class="ei">-man</span> or <span class="ei">-woman</span> in the names of jobs. For example, you can use <span class="eb">police officer</span> instead of <span class="ei">policeman</span> or <span class="ei">policewoman</span>, and <span class="eb">spokesperson</span> instead of <span class="ei">spokesman</span> or <span class="ei">spokeswoman</span>. Neutral words are very common in newspapers, on television and radio and in official writing, in both <span class="labels" hclass="labels" htag="span">British English</span> and <span class="labels" hclass="labels" htag="span">North American English</span>.</li><li class="li">When talking about jobs that are traditionally done by the other sex, some people say: <span class="eb">a male secretary</span>/<span class="eb">nurse</span>/<span class="eb">model</span> (NOT <span class="eb">man</span>) or <span class="eb">a woman</span>/<span class="eb">female</span> <span class="eb">doctor</span>/<span class="eb">barrister</span>/<span class="eb">driver</span>. However this is now not usually used unless you need to emphasize which sex the person is, or it is still unusual for the job to be done by a man/​woman: <span class="unx">My daughter prefers to see a woman doctor.</span><span class="unx">They have a male nanny for their kids.</span><span class="unx">a female racing driver</span></li></ul><span class="unbox">Pronouns</span><ul class="bullet"><li class="li"><span class="eb">He</span> used to be considered to cover both men and women: <span class="unx">Everyone needs to feel he is loved.</span> This is not now acceptable.

He/​she can give you more information.</span> (You may find that some writers just use ‘she’.) These uses can seem awkward when they are used a lot. It is better to try to change the sentence, using a plural noun. Instead of saying: <span class="unx">A baby cries when he or she is tired</span> you can say <span class="unx">Babies cry when they are tired.</span></li></ul></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_chairwoman__gb_2" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_chairwoman__gb_2.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_chairwoman__us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_chairwoman__us_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_chairwomen__gb_2" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_chairwomen__gb_2.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_chairwomen__us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_chairwomen__us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
