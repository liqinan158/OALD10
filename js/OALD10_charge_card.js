When the <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/cardholder" title="cardholder definition"><span class="ndv">cardholder</span></a></span> is present, for example, in a shop or restaurant, they <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/insert#insert_1" title="insert definition"><span class="ndv">insert</span></a> their card into a special machine and key in their <span class="eb">PIN</span> (<a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/pin#pin_3" title="personal identification number definition"><span class="ndv">personal identification number</span></a>). For smaller amounts, it is often possible to make a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/contactless" title="contactless definition"><span class="ndv">contactless</span></a></span> payment, which involves simply holding the card over the card machine. Purchases by credit or debit card can also be made on the internet or over the telephone. Credit cards and debit cards can be used to get money from a cash <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/cash-machine" title="cash machine definition"><span class="ndv">cash machine</span></a>. Cards linked to organizations such as <span class="eb">Visa</span> and <span class="eb">MasterCard</span> can be used in many countries.

Cardholders receive <span class="eb">statements</span> each month showing all their purchases and must pay at least part of the bill. They are charged <span class="eb">interest</span> on the amount they do not pay.</span><span class="p">The term <span class="ei">credit card</span> is sometimes used to include <span class="eb">charge cards</span>, but the whole amount owed on a charge card account must be paid each month, while credit card payments can be paid back in <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/instalment" title="instalments definition"><span class="ndv">instalments</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= regular payments over a period of time)</span>. One of the most famous charge cards is <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/american-expresstm#american_express_topg_1" title="American Express definition"><span class="ndv">American Express</span></a> (although the company also provides credit cards). Some people have an <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/affinity-card" title="affinity card definition"><span class="ndv">affinity card</span></a></span>, a credit card that is linked to a charity. Each time the card is used, the card company pays a small amount of money to the charity. Credit cards from shops, called <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/store-card" title="store cards definition"><span class="ndv">store cards</span></a></span> or sometimes charge cards, can usually be used only in branches of the shop concerned.

The use of credit, debit and store cards is also very common in Britain. People decide which cards to have depending on the way they plan to use them. For example, some cards are free but have a high rate of interest, called the <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/apr" title="APR definition"><span class="ndv">APR</span></a></span> (annual percentage rate) or ; others have an <span class="eb">annual fee</span>, but charge lower interest rates, and so are good for people who do not pay the whole bill every month.</span></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_charge_card_1_gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_charge_card_1_gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_charge_card_1_us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_charge_card_1_us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
