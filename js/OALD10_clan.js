In the 11th century, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/tribe" title="tribes definition"><span class="ndv">tribes</span></a> living in Scotland divided into small clans that settled round <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/loch" title="lochs definition"><span class="ndv">lochs</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= lakes)</span> and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/glen#glen_1" title="glens definition"><span class="ndv">glens</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= valleys)</span>, and on the islands. Among the most powerful were the Campbells and the MacGregors of Argyll, the MacLeods and the MacDonalds of the Western Isles, the MacKays of Caithness and the Stewarts of Appin. The <span class="eb">chief</span> of each clan had complete authority. <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/clansman" title="Clansmen definition"><span class="ndv">Clansmen</span></a></span> were known by the name of their father, and this was shown by adding <span class="ei">Mac-</span> to the beginning of the father's name.

Being a member of a clan did not in fact depend on sharing the same name, and many clan members were not related to the chief, but were admitted to the clan as supporters.</span><span class="p">The clans often fought one another. The most famous argument was between the Campbells and the MacDonalds. After <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/william-iii" title="William III definition"><span class="ndv">William III</span></a> became king in 1688, many clans joined the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/jacobite#jacobite_topg_1" title="Jacobites definition"><span class="ndv">Jacobites</span></a> who supported the former <span class="ndv" href="romancatholic_d_1" tofix="" xt="andv">Roman Catholic</span> king, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/james-ii" title="James II definition"><span class="ndv">James II</span></a>.

The Campbells were sent to punish them, resulting in the Massacre of Glencoe (1692), in which many MacDonalds were murdered.</span><span class="p">The clans fought together with the Jacobites against the English in 1715 and again, under <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/bonny-prince-charlie" title="Bonny Prince Charlie definition"><span class="ndv">Bonny Prince Charlie</span></a>, in 1745, but they were finally defeated at <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-battle-of-culloden" title="the Battle of Culloden definition"><span class="ndv">the Battle of Culloden</span></a> (1746).
