In 1947, when the mines were <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/nationalize" title="nationalized definition"><span class="ndv">nationalized</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= brought under government control)</span>, there were still about 1 000 collieries and 700 000 miners.

By the middle of the 1980s there were only 160 collieries and 200 000 miners.

In the 1990s more mines were closed. In mining communities throughout Britain thousands of former miners struggled to find new jobs. Collieries returned to being owned by private companies in 1994, and most coal now produced in Britain is sold to the electricity-generating industry. </span><span class="p">The US is the world's second largest producer of coal and most is mined in the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-appalachian-mountains#the_appalachian_mountains_topg_1" title="Appalachian Mountains definition"><span class="ndv">Appalachian Mountains</span></a>. Modern mining techniques used in <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/west-virginia" title="West Virginia definition"><span class="ndv">West Virginia</span></a> have removed whole mountain tops and destroyed large areas of forest. Coal is used especially in the electricity-generating industry and in the making of steel. However, the industry is in decline and several of the largest mining companies have gone out of business since 2015 as electricity is increasingly generated in other ways.</span></span></span></div> </li></ol><div class="idioms" hclass="idioms" htag="div" id="coalmine_idmgs_1"><span class="idioms_heading">Idioms</span> <span class="idm-g" id="coalmine_idmg_1" new="y" sk="canaryincoalmine"><div class="top-container"><div class="top-g" id="coalmine_topg_1"><div class="webtop"><span class="idm" id="coalmine_idm_1">a canary in a/the coal mine</span> </div></div></div><ol class="sense_single" htag="ol"><li class="sense" hclass="sense" htag="li" id="coalmine_sng_2"><span class="sensetop" hclass="sensetop" htag="span"><span class="def" hclass="def" htag="span">something that gives you an early warning of danger</span></span><ul class="examples" hclass="examples" htag="ul"><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_coal_mine__1"><span class="x">Among the species at risk is the silvery minnow, the river's equivalent of a canary in a coal mine. </span></li></ul> </li></ol></span></div></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_coal_mine_1_gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_coal_mine_1_gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_coal_mine_1_us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_coal_mine_1_us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
