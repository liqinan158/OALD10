Many British upper-class families, as well as thousands of public institutions such as city councils and universities, have the right to their own coat of arms or <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/shield#shield_1" title="shield definition"><span class="ndv">shield</span></a>. This is often printed on writing paper, shown on uniforms and the sides of official vehicles, and put above the door of buildings.

The designs painted on these shields were originally a way to identify the person carrying the shield. They then became family <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/emblem" title="emblems definition"><span class="ndv">emblems</span></a> which have changed little through the centuries. Sometimes the devices have been changed to combine the coats of arms of two families. A husband may <span class="eb">impale</span> his wife's family arms by dividing the shield down the middle from top to bottom and putting his own arms on the <span class="eb">dexter</span> side <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= the right side for the person holding the shield)</span> and his wife's on the <span class="eb">sinister</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= left)</span> side.</span><span class="p">Heraldry uses many technical terms, which mostly come from Old French. The background of a shield is known as the <span class="eb">field</span> and its main colour the <span class="eb">tincture</span>. The heraldic designs on the field are known as <span class="eb">charges</span>. They may include a simple <span class="eb">pale</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= broad band going from top to bottom)</span> or a <span class="eb">fess</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= thin band going from left to right)</span>, or a more complex device such as an animal, a cross or a castle. Shields are often <span class="eb"><span class="ndv" href="quarter_subentryg_2:quarter_topg_3" tofix="">quartered</span></span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= divided into four quarters)</span>, with each quarter carrying a different design. On the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-royal-arms#the_royal_arms_topg_1" title="royal arms definition"><span class="ndv">royal arms</span></a>, the quarters represent different countries. The first and fourth quarters are <span class="eb">gules</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= red)</span> and each contains three lions <span class="eb">passant</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= walking)</span> shown in <span class="eb">or</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= gold)</span> to represent England. The second quarter contains a red lion <span class="eb">rampant</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= standing on its back legs)</span>, the symbol of Scotland, within a <span class="eb">tressure</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= border)</span> on a gold background.

Wales is not included because it had its own heraldic device in the arms of the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/prince-of-wales" title="Prince of Wales definition"><span class="ndv">Prince of Wales</span></a> before the <span class="eb">quarterings</span> for Scotland and Ireland were added to the royal arms.</span><span class="p">In most coats of arms the shield is surrounded by additional decorations, such as a pair of animal or human <span class="eb">supporters</span> (for instance, the lion and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/unicorn" title="unicorn definition"><span class="ndv">unicorn</span></a> on the royal arms), a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/crown#crown_1" title="crown definition"><span class="ndv">crown</span></a> or <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/helmet" title="helmet definition"><span class="ndv">helmet</span></a>, and a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/motto" title="motto definition"><span class="ndv">motto</span></a></span>. On the royal arms the motto is <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/dieu-et-mon-droit" title="Dieu et mon droit definition"><span class="ndv">Dieu et mon droit</span></a>, French for 'God and my right'.</span><span class="p">Many Americans whose families came from Europe try to find their origins and identify their <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/ancestor" title="ancestors' definition"><span class="ndv">ancestors'</span></a> coat of arms. They may then use it on objects such as drinking glasses, or hang a drawing of the coat of arms in their house. For many people a coat of arms provides a connection with the past and a way of showing that they are proud of their family.</span></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_coat_of_arms_1_gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_coat_of_arms_1_gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_coat_of_arms_1_us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_coat_of_arms_1_us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
