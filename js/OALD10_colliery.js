In 1947, when the mines were <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/nationalize" title="nationalized definition"><span class="ndv">nationalized</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= brought under government control)</span>, there were still about 1 000 collieries and 700 000 miners.

By the middle of the 1980s there were only 160 collieries and 200 000 miners.

In the 1990s more mines were closed. In mining communities throughout Britain thousands of former miners struggled to find new jobs.

Coal is used especially in the electricity-generating industry and in the making of steel. However, the industry is in decline and several of the largest mining companies have gone out of business since 2015 as electricity is increasingly generated in other ways.</span></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_colliery__gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_colliery__gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_colliery__us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_colliery__us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
