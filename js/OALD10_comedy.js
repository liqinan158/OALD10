class="eb">humor</span>), an ability to see the <span class="eb">funny side of life</span>, is considered essential by most British and American people. Everyone needs to be able to <span class="eb">laugh at themselves</span> sometimes, and to recognize that the situation they are in may look funny to others. It is considered a serious criticism of somebody to say that they have no sense of humour. When people are trying to meet other people, for example on an <span class="eb">internet dating site</span>, they often ask for possible partners to have a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/gsoh" title="GSOH definition"><span class="ndv">GSOH</span></a></span> (good sense of humour).</span><span class="p">Some people have a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/dry#dry_sng_7" title="dry definition"><span class="ndv">dry</span></a></span> sense of humour, and can <span class="eb">keep a straight face</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= not smile)</span> and make their voice sound as though they are being serious when they are joking.

A person's sense of humour is influenced by many things, including family and social background and age.</span><span class="p">British and American humour on stage have some important differences, although the fact that some <span class="eb">comedy</span> television shows are popular in both countries shows that there is common ground. For example, American TV shows such as <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-simpsons" title="The Simpsons definition"><span class="ndv">The Simpsons</span></a> and <span class="ei">The Big Bang Theory</span> are as popular in Britain as some of its own TV comedy shows. <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/sitcom" title="Sitcoms definition"><span class="ndv">Sitcoms</span></a></span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= shows in which the humour comes from situations that the characters get into)</span> often have a <span class="eb">laugh track</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= a recording of people laughing)</span> so that the audience at home will know when things people say and do are meant to be funny. In many sitcoms gentle fun is made of ordinary life without the risk of causing anyone serious offence.</span><span class="p">American stage humour is more direct than British comedy. In the American series <span class="ei">Parks and Recreation</span>, for instance, the humour comes from characters behaving in stupid ways. But in the British comedy <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/fawlty-towers" title="Fawlty Towers definition"><span class="ndv">Fawlty Towers</span></a> Basil Fawlty's funny characteristics are <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/exaggerated" title="exaggerated definition"><span class="ndv">exaggerated</span></a> versions of those found in the type of person he represents. David Brent's character in <span class="ebi">The Office</span> is funny for the same reason. <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/slapstick" title="Slapstick definition"><span class="ndv">Slapstick</span></a></span> comedy, which is based on people falling over, crashing into each other, etc. is now less popular in Britain.</span><span class="p">British comedy often makes use of <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/irony" title="irony definition"><span class="ndv">irony</span></a></span>, humour which depends on suggesting the opposite of what is actually expressed. Many novels, films, stage plays, etc. use irony, even when discussing serious subjects such as death.
