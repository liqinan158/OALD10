Most US newspapers contain comic strips that are read by both adults and children. On Mondays to Saturdays they are usually four frames long, printed in black and white. On Sundays they are longer and in colour. Comic strips are also popular in British newspapers. Many can be found on the internet.</span><span class="p">Most comic strips make jokes about the characters in them and the things that happen to them. For instance, in the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/peanuts" title="Peanuts definition"><span class="ndv">Peanuts</span></a> comic strips (1950-2000) many of the jokes are about <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/charlie-brown" title="Charlie Brown definition"><span class="ndv">Charlie Brown</span></a>, who has very bad luck, and his friend Lucy, who is not kind to him. In <span class="ei">Calvin and Hobbes</span> (1985-1995) , the humour comes from the relationship between a boy and his imaginary friend, a toy <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/tiger" title="tiger definition"><span class="ndv">tiger</span></a>. Comic strips in British newspapers include <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/andy-capptm#andy_capp_topg_1" title="Andy Capp definition"><span class="ndv">Andy Capp</span></a> and <span class="ei">The Perishers</span>.

Most newspapers also print single frames that comment in a humorous way on politicians and other people in the news. These are known as <span class="eb">cartoons</span>.</span><span class="p">In Britain a <span class="ei">comic</span> is a picture magazine, usually for children. Comics contain short stories written as comic strips, and sometimes also competitions and articles. Popular children's comics include <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-beano#the_beano_topg_1" title="Beano definition"><span class="ndv">Beano</span></a>, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-dandy#the_dandy_topg_1" title="Dandy definition"><span class="ndv">Dandy</span></a>, and <span class="ei">2000 AD</span>, which features mainly <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/science-fiction" title="science fiction definition"><span class="ndv">science fiction</span></a> stories. Comics for very young children are often based on popular television programmes, such as <span class="ei">Thomas and Friends</span> (which features <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/thomas-the-tank-engine" title="Thomas the Tank Engine definition"><span class="ndv">Thomas the Tank Engine</span></a>). Adult comics, such as <span class="ei">Viz</span>, are usually very rude.</span><span class="p">Some of the characters in <span class="ei">Beano</span> and <span class="ei">Dandy</span> have not changed much over the years and now look old-fashioned. Teachers, for instance, still wear <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/mortar-board" title="mortar boards definition"><span class="ndv">mortar boards</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= stiff black hats with a square top)</span>, though real teachers stopped wearing them long ago. Many of the most popular comics appear in the form of books, called <span class="eb"><span class="ndv" href="annual_subentryg_2:annual_topg_3" tofix="">annuals</span></span>, around Christmas each year.</span><span class="p"><span class="eb">Comic books</span> are similar to comics. Each book has a set of characters who have adventures.
