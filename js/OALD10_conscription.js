This was not popular with most young men, and national service was ended in 1960. Since then, Britain has depended on <span class="eb">volunteers</span> to join the services. Some young people join an <span class="eb">Officers' Training Corps</span> while at school or university, or become members of the <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-territorial-army" title="Territorial Army definition"><span class="ndv">Territorial Army</span></a></span>. From time to time politicians and others call for national service to be introduced again, believing that military life is a good way to encourage discipline among young people.</span><span class="p">In the US national service is called <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/selective-service" title="selective service definition"><span class="ndv">selective service</span></a></span> or conscription, but its popular name is <span class="eb">the draft</span>. It was first introduced during the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/civil-war" title="Civil War definition"><span class="ndv">Civil War</span></a> by both the North and the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-confederate-states" title="Confederate States definition"><span class="ndv">Confederate States</span></a>, and was not popular. One reason for this was that anyone could avoid service if he paid money ($300), or hired somebody to replace him. This led to <span class="eb">draft riots</span> by poor people in New York City, and almost 1 000 African Americans and others were killed.</span><span class="p">The US next used conscription during the First World War and 10 million men put their names on the draft list. America's first conscription when the country was not itself at war began in 1940 when Europe was fighting in World War Two. A man could receive an <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/exemption" title="exemption definition"><span class="ndv">exemption</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= avoid service)</span> for physical or mental reasons, or because he had an important job. There were also some conscientious objectors who had to take jobs provided by the government.</span><span class="p">The draft was stopped in 1947 but started again a year later, and men aged 18–25 had to serve 21 months. This supplied soldiers for the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/korean" title="Korean War definition"><span class="ndv">Korean War</span></a> and the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-vietnam-war" title="Vietnam War definition"><span class="ndv">Vietnam War</span></a>. Many young men did not want to fight in Vietnam and some tried to stay in college and university because students did not have to go. <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/draft-dodger" title="Draft dodgers definition"><span class="ndv">Draft dodgers</span></a></span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= people who avoided the draft)</span> sometimes burned their <span class="eb">draft cards</span> or went abroad. Conscription was finally ended in 1973 but although the draft has ended, all men must put their names on the selective service list when they become 18 in case there is a national emergency.</span></span></span></div><div class="collapse" hclass="collapse" htag="div"><span class="unbox" id="conscription_unbox_2" unbox="extra_examples"><span class="box_title" onclick="toggle_active(this)">Extra Examples</span><ul class="examples" hclass="examples" htag="ul"><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_conscription__2"><span class="unx">He injured himself to avoid conscription.</span></li><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_conscription__3"><span class="unx">his decision to institute military conscription</span></li></ul></span></div><span class="topic-g"><span class="prefix">Topics </span><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/topic/war-and-conflict?level=c2" title="Topic war-and-conflict"><span class="topic" href="l2:politics_and_society:war_and_conflict?cefr=c2"><span class="topic_name">War and conflict</span><span class="topic_cefr">c2</span></span></a></span><div class="collapse" hclass="collapse" htag="div"><span class="unbox" id="conscription_unbox_3" unbox="snippet"><span class="box_title" onclick="toggle_active(this)">Oxford Collocations Dictionary</span><span class="body"><span class="unbox">adjective</span><ul class="collocs_list"><li class="li">universal</li><li class="li">military</li><li class="li">compulsory</li><li class="li">…</li></ul><span class="unbox">verb + conscription</span><ul class="collocs_list"><li class="li">introduce</li><li class="li">abolish</li><li class="li">end</li><li class="li">…</li></ul><span class="xref_to_full_entry">See <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/collocations/conscription" title=" definition in Collocations">full entry</a></span></span></span></div><div class="collapse" hclass="collapse" htag="div"><span class="unbox" id="conscription_unbox_4" unbox="wordorigin"><span class="box_title" onclick="toggle_active(this)">Word Origin</span><span class="body"><span class="p">early 19th cent.: via French (conscription was introduced in France in 1798), from late Latin <span class="ei">conscriptio(n-)</span> ‘levying of troops’, from Latin <span class="ei">conscribere</span> ‘write down together, enrol’, from <span class="ei">con-</span> ‘together’ + <span class="ei">scribere</span> ‘write’.</span></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_xconscription__gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_xconscription__gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_xconscription__us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_xconscription__us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
