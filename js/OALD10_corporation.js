A <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/statutory" title="statutory definition"><span class="ndv">statutory</span></a> company</span> is set up by an <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/act-of-parliament" title="Act of Parliament definition"><span class="ndv">Act of Parliament</span></a>. Many former statutory companies that were managed by the government, such as those responsible for Britain's railway system and coal industry, have now been <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/privatize" title="privatized definition"><span class="ndv">privatized</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= sold and made into private companies operating for profit)</span>.</span><span class="p">Most commercial businesses in Britain are <span class="eb">registered companies</span>. Lists of these are kept by the Registrar of Companies, and company information and accounts are kept at <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/companies-house" title="Companies House definition"><span class="ndv">Companies House</span></a>. Registered companies may be either <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/private-company" title="private companies definition"><span class="ndv">private companies</span></a></span> or <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/public-company" title="public companies definition"><span class="ndv">public companies</span></a></span>. Private companies have a limited number of <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/shareholder" title="shareholders definition"><span class="ndv">shareholders</span></a></span> (or <span class="eb">members</span>), and their shares are not available to the general public. Shares in public companies can be bought and sold by the public on the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/stock-exchange" title="stock exchange definition"><span class="ndv">stock exchange</span></a>.</span><span class="p">A <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/limited-company" title="limited company definition"><span class="ndv">limited company</span></a></span>, sometimes called a <span class="eb">limited liability company</span>, can be either private or public. The <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/liability" title="liability definition"><span class="ndv">liability</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= responsibility)</span> of shareholders for any losses is limited to the value of their shares. Private limited companies have the letters <span class="eb">Ltd</span> after their name. A <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/public-limited-company" title="public limited company definition"><span class="ndv">public limited company</span></a></span> (<span class="eb">plc</span>) must offer its shares for sale to the public. Most large companies in Britain, such as <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/bp" title="BP definition"><span class="ndv">BP</span></a>, for example, are public limited companies. A special type of limited company, the <span class="eb">company limited by <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/guarantee#guarantee_1" title="guarantee definition"><span class="ndv">guarantee</span></a></span>, is used especially for charities. Rather than buy shares, its members promise to pay for a share of debts if it fails.</span><span class="p">Most businesses in the US are <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/corporation" title="corporations definition"><span class="ndv">corporations</span></a></span>, which are similar to British limited companies. A limited liability company is often referred to as an <span class="eb">LLC</span>. People who invest money in them are <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/liable" title="liable definition"><span class="ndv">liable</span></a> for <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= risk losing)</span> only the amount they have invested. Some corporations sell their shares on the stock exchange, but others do not. Small corporations, for example family businesses, may be called <span class="eb">close corporations</span>. Corporations often have the letters <span class="eb">Inc.</span> (short for ‘ <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/incorporated" title="incorporated definition"><span class="ndv">incorporated</span></a> ’) after their name. The laws about how corporations are formed and should operate vary from state to state.</span><span class="p">In both Britain and the US, professional businesses like law firms are often <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/partnership" title="partnerships definition"><span class="ndv">partnerships</span></a></span>, which consist of two or more people who own a business and are together responsible for its debts. In a <span class="eb">limited partnership</span> ‘general partners’ run the business and take responsibility for debts while ‘limited partners’ only invest money.</span><span class="p">A <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/sole#sole_1" title="sole definition"><span class="ndv">sole</span></a> <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/proprietorship" title="proprietorship definition"><span class="ndv">proprietorship</span></a></span> is run by one person only. Many small businesses in the US operate in this way because the rules are much simpler than those for corporations. Sole proprietorships do not have limited liability. If the name of the business is not the same as the name of the person who runs it, the letters <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/d-b-a" title="d.b.a. definition"><span class="ndv">d.b.a.</span></a></span> are used, short for <span class="eb">doing business as</span>, for example 'Ted Smith, d.b.a.
