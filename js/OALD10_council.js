England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Wales is divided into 22 counties and <span class="eb">county boroughs</span> and Northern Ireland has 11 districts.

Most councillors belong to a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/political" title="political definition"><span class="ndv">political</span></a> party and, especially at county level, people often vote for them as representatives of a party, not as individuals.

Many people are employed by councils, but many services are also now carried out by private companies who are given contracts by the council. Councils receive some money from central government in the form of <span class="eb">grants</span>, they also collect <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/council-tax" title="council tax definition"><span class="ndv">council tax</span></a></span> from each household, a tax based on the value of the house.</span><span class="p">In the US, local government has three levels, with the <span class="eb">State government</span>, <span class="eb">County government</span> and below that, towns and cities.

Services provided by a county government depend on the area, and whether it is mainly urban or rural. In urban areas, city and county governments may work together to provide services for the area. Counties usually have a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/sheriff" title="sheriff's definition"><span class="ndv">sheriff's</span></a> department</span>, a kind of police department, whose officers are called <span class="eb">sheriff's <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/deputy" title="deputies definition"><span class="ndv">deputies</span></a></span>.</span><span class="p">America's cities, towns and other <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/municipality" title="municipalities definition"><span class="ndv">municipalities</span></a> vary from small towns of a few hundred people to cities of millions.
