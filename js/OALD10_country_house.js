The houses are called <span class="ei">stately homes</span> from the opening lines of a poem by Felicia Hemans (1793–1835). They are sometimes also called <span class="eb">country houses</span> because most of them are in the countryside. Some are approached through large iron gates down a long <span class="eb">drive</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= private road)</span>.

They charge visitors an <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/admission" title="admission definition"><span class="ndv">admission</span></a> fee</span>. Many stately homes have been given by their owners to the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-national-trust" title="National Trust definition"><span class="ndv">National Trust</span></a>, an organization which raises the money to look after them from gifts, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/membership" title="membership definition"><span class="ndv">membership</span></a> fees and admission charges. In many cases, the former owners continue to live in part of the house. This arrangement means that the house is well cared for, and the family does not have to pay <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/inheritance-tax" title="inheritance tax definition"><span class="ndv">inheritance tax</span></a> when the owner dies.</span><span class="p">Visitors go to stately homes to admire their architecture, and to walk round the gardens. They also go to see valuable furniture, paintings, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/tapestry" title="tapestries definition"><span class="ndv">tapestries</span></a> and china that have been collected over a long period. Sometimes, documents about the family or about historical events are also displayed. There is generally a cafe and a shop selling <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/souvenir" title="souvenirs definition"><span class="ndv">souvenirs</span></a>.
