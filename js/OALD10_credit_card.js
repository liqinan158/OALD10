Purchases by credit or debit card can also be made on the internet or over the telephone. Credit cards and debit cards can be used to get money from a cash <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/cash-machine" title="cash machine definition"><span class="ndv">cash machine</span></a>. Cards linked to organizations such as <span class="eb">Visa</span> and <span class="eb">MasterCard</span> can be used in many countries.
