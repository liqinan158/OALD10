In the US the <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-death-penalty" title="death penalty definition"><span class="ndv">death penalty</span></a></span> is used in many states. In 1972 the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-supreme-court" title="Supreme Court definition"><span class="ndv">Supreme Court</span></a> decided that it was ‘cruel and unusual punishment’, which the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/constitution" title="Constitution definition"><span class="ndv">Constitution</span></a> does not allow, and it became illegal until 1976, when the Court changed its mind.</span><span class="p">Different methods of <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/execution" title="execution definition"><span class="ndv">execution</span></a></span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= killing)</span> can be used in different states.

Since 1976 about 1 500 people have been <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/execute" title="executed definition"><span class="ndv">executed</span></a>. Most people who receive the death sentence appeal to higher courts, and the sentence may be changed. The legal system moves slowly, so that a long time passes between the sentence being given and the execution taking place. The result is that there are about 3 000 prisoners <span class="eb">on death row</span>, waiting to be executed. The state <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/governor" title="governor definition"><span class="ndv">governor</span></a> or a court can give a <span class="eb">stay of execution</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= a delay so that the prisoner has time to appeal to another court)</span>, and the governor or the president can a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/grant#grant_1" title="grant definition"><span class="ndv">grant</span></a> a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/pardon#pardon_1" title="pardon definition"><span class="ndv">pardon</span></a></span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= decide not to carry out the execution)</span>. This can happen at any time until the execution takes place. </span><span class="p">Another reason why many death sentences are not carried out is that there is strong opposition to capital punishment. People argue that it is <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/immoral" title="immoral definition"><span class="ndv">immoral</span></a> and that if a mistake is made it cannot be put right. They also say that the death penalty does not prevent people from committing murder. Another strong argument is that more African Americans who are found guilty of murder are sentenced to death than other <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/racial" title="racial definition"><span class="ndv">racial</span></a> groups and this is unfair.</span><span class="p">In Britain the death penalty for murder was ended in 1965, but it could still in theory be passed on anyone found guilty of <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/treason" title="treason definition"><span class="ndv">treason</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= crimes against the state)</span> until 1998. Some British people think that <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-death-penalty" title="the death penalty definition"><span class="ndv">the death penalty</span></a> should be brought back for crimes such as <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/terrorism" title="terrorism definition"><span class="ndv">terrorism</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= the use of violence for political aims)</span> or the murder of a police officer, but Parliament has voted several times against this. In former times about 200 crimes were <span class="eb">capital <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/offence" title="offences definition"><span class="ndv">offences</span></a></span>, for which the punishment was hanging. The wooden <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/gallows" title="gallows definition"><span class="ndv">gallows</span></a></span> or <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/gibbet" title="gibbet definition"><span class="ndv">gibbet</span></a></span> on which criminals were hanged can still be seen in some places. Many criminals were hanged in public at <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/tyburn" title="Tyburn definition"><span class="ndv">Tyburn</span></a> in London, and later at <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/newgate" title="Newgate definition"><span class="ndv">Newgate</span></a> prison. People found guilty of treason were <span class="eb">hanged, drawn and quartered</span>, which means they were hanged on the gallows, then taken down while still alive and some of their internal organs cut out. Their heads were cut off and their bodies cut into four pieces.</span></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_electric_chair_1_gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_electric_chair_1_gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_electric_chair_1_us_4" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_electric_chair_1_us_4.mp3"></audio>`;
