Many visitors to Britain think that because the British do not express their feelings easily they are cold and they don't care about people. <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/lip#stiff_idmg_2" title="Keeping a stiff upper lip definition"><span class="ndv">Keeping a stiff upper lip</span></a></span>, not showing or talking about your feelings, was thought in the past to be a sign of strong character, and people who revealed their feelings were thought to be weak or <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/mannered#mannered_sng_2" title="bad-mannered definition"><span class="ndv">bad-mannered</span></a>. This attitude is far less common today and people are now encouraged to show or talk about their feelings.</span><span class="p">Most British men, and some women, are embarrassed to be seen crying in public. People are also embarrassed when they see somebody crying, and do not know whether it is better to pretend they have not noticed or to try and comfort them. Women are more likely to respond than men and will put their arm round the person or touch their shoulder. Many people now show feelings of <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/affection" title="affection definition"><span class="ndv">affection</span></a> in public. People sometimes kiss each other on the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/cheek#cheek_1" title="cheek definition"><span class="ndv">cheek</span></a> as a greeting and may greet or say goodbye to each other with a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/hug#hug_1" title="hug definition"><span class="ndv">hug</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= putting their arms round each other)</span>. <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/lover#lover_sng_1" title="Lovers definition"><span class="ndv">Lovers</span></a> hold hands in public, and sometimes <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/embrace#embrace_sng_3" title="embrace definition"><span class="ndv">embrace</span></a> and kiss each other. Some British people are embarrassed about showing anger. If somebody starts to complain in public, for example, about being kept waiting in a restaurant, people around them may pretend not to hear and avoid getting involved.</span><span class="p">When British people are part of a crowd they are less worried about expressing their emotions. Football crowds sing and they <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/cheer#cheer_1" title="cheer definition"><span class="ndv">cheer</span></a> when their side scores a goal.
