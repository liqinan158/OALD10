fitness</span><span class="p">The British like <span class="eb">sport</span> very much, but many people prefer to watch rather than take part. Many go to watch football, rugby, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/cricket" title="cricket definition"><span class="ndv">cricket</span></a>, etc. at the ground, but many more sit at home and watch sport on television.</span><span class="p">Most people today take relatively little general <span class="eb">exercise</span>. Over the last 30 or 40 years lifestyles have changed considerably and many people now travel even the shortest distances by car or bus. Lack of exercise combined with eating too much fat and sugar has meant that many people are becoming too fat. Experts are particularly concerned that children spend a lot of their free time watching television or playing computer games instead of being active. In recent years, however, there has been a growing interest in fitness among young adults and many belong to a <span class="eb">sports club</span> or <span class="eb">gym</span>.</span><span class="p">In Britain most towns have an <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/amateur#amateur_1" title="amateur definition"><span class="ndv">amateur</span></a> football and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/cricket" title="cricket definition"><span class="ndv">cricket</span></a> team, and people also have opportunities to play sports such as tennis and golf. Older people may play <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/bowl#bowl_sng_6" title="bowls definition"><span class="ndv">bowls</span></a>. Some people go regularly to a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/sports-centre" title="sports centre definition"><span class="ndv">sports centre</span></a></span> or <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/leisure-centre" title="leisure centre definition"><span class="ndv">leisure centre</span></a></span> where there are facilities for playing <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/badminton#badminton_1" title="badminton definition"><span class="ndv">badminton</span></a> and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/squash#squash_1" title="squash definition"><span class="ndv">squash</span></a>, and also a swimming pool.

Other people keep themselves fit by walking or cycling. Many people go abroad on a <span class="eb">skiing</span> holiday each year and there are several dry slopes and snow domes in Britain where they can practise.</span><span class="p">Membership of a sports club or gym can be expensive and not everyone can afford it. Local sports centres are generally cheaper. <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/evening-class" title="Evening classes definition"><span class="ndv">Evening classes</span></a></span> are also cheap and offer a wide variety of fitness activities ranging from <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/yoga" title="yoga definition"><span class="ndv">yoga</span></a> and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/pilates" title="Pilates definition"><span class="ndv">Pilates</span></a> to jazz dancing. Some companies now provide sports facilities for their employees or contribute to the cost of joining a gym.</span><span class="p">Sports play an important part in American life. Professional baseball and football games attract large crowds, and many people watch games on television.
