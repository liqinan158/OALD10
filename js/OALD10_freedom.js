citizens are laid down in the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/constitution" title="constitution definition"><span class="ndv">constitution</span></a> and the first ten <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/amendment" title="amendments definition"><span class="ndv">amendments</span></a> to it, which are together called the <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/bill-of-rights" title="Bill of Rights definition"><span class="ndv">Bill of Rights</span></a></span>. The Constitution was written in the late 1700s to explain not only how the US government would work, but also what limits there would be on its power. At that time, people were beginning to believe that the rights of individuals were important, and that the government was the main threat to those rights. Limiting the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/federal-government#federal_government_topg_1" title="federal government's definition"><span class="ndv">federal government's</span></a> power was also seen as necessary to protect the rights of states within the United States.</span><span class="p">The UK does not have a written constitution or legal document describing the rights of individuals but for British people freedom to live without the government getting involved is important. Proposals to introduce <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/identity-card" title="identity cards definition"><span class="ndv">identity cards</span></a></span> for everyone are always resisted and people often talk about the <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/nanny#nanny_idmg_1" title="nanny state definition"><span class="ndv">nanny state</span></a></span> when they feel the government is interfering in their lives.</span><span class="p">In the UK and the US the most basic rights include <span class="eb">freedom of expression</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= freedom to say or write what you think)</span>, <span class="eb">freedom of choice</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= freedom to make decisions about your own life)</span> and <span class="eb">freedom of <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/worship#worship_1" title="worship definition"><span class="ndv">worship</span></a></span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= freedom to practise any religion)</span>.</span><span class="p">Freedom of expression does not imply complete freedom for people to say what they like. In the US the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-first-amendment" title="First Amendment definition"><span class="ndv">First Amendment</span></a> protects freedom of speech and of the press but the courts, especially the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-supreme-court" title="Supreme Court definition"><span class="ndv">Supreme Court</span></a>, decide how it should be applied. For instance, a newspaper is not allowed to print something bad about a person that is known not to be true: this is <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/libel#libel_1" title="libel definition"><span class="ndv">libel</span></a>. The courts do not practise <span class="eb">prior restraint</span>, which means they cannot stop a newspaper from printing something, but they can punish the newspaper afterwards. However, in a few cases, for example when national security is involved, the courts may order newspapers not to print a report.</span><span class="p">The right to free speech in the US has not always been respected. In the 1950s, when <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/mccarthyism" title="McCarthyism definition"><span class="ndv">McCarthyism</span></a> was at its height, people who were suspected of being <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/communist#communist_1" title="Communists definition"><span class="ndv">Communists</span></a> were called before <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/congress#congress_sng_2" title="Congress definition"><span class="ndv">Congress</span></a> to answer questions. People who used their right to free speech and said they believed in <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/communism" title="Communism definition"><span class="ndv">Communism</span></a>, or who <span class="eb">took the Fifth</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= used their right under the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-fifth-amendment#the_fifth_amendment_topg_1" title="Fifth Amendment definition"><span class="ndv">Fifth Amendment</span></a> not to give evidence against themselves)</span> often lost their jobs or went to prison.</span><span class="p">In the UK until 1968 all plays had to be approved by the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-lord-chamberlain" title="Lord Chamberlain definition"><span class="ndv">Lord Chamberlain</span></a> before they could be performed in theatres. <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/censorship" title="Censorship definition"><span class="ndv">Censorship</span></a></span> of the press ended in the 1960s. In the 2000s, a number of newspaper journalists were caught listening to and reading people's phone messages, a practice known as <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/phone-hacking" title="phone hacking definition"><span class="ndv">phone hacking</span></a></span>. As a result, in 2011 a commission was set up under a senior judge, Lord Justice Leveson, to investigate this and other aspects of the British press. The commission proposed that an independent organization should replace the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-press-complaints-commission" title="Press Complaints Commission definition"><span class="ndv">Press Complaints Commission</span></a> and as a result the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-press-complaints-commission#the_press_complaints_commission_topg_1" title="Independent Press Standards Organisation definition"><span class="ndv">Independent Press Standards Organisation</span></a> was established in 2014.</span><span class="p">The <span class="eb">right of equal opportunity</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= the right to be treated the same as others, whatever a person's race, sex, etc.)</span> is <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/enforced" title="enforced definition"><span class="ndv">enforced</span></a> in the UK through the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/equality" title="Equality Act definition"><span class="ndv">Equality Act</span></a> of 2010. In the US the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-civil-rights-movement" title="civil rights movement definition"><span class="ndv">civil rights movement</span></a> of the 1960s influenced the making of new laws to protect the rights of minority groups, especially <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/african-american#african_american_topg_3" title="African Americans definition"><span class="ndv">African Americans</span></a>. In 1972 an <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-equal-rights-amendment#the_equal_rights_amendment_topg_1" title="Equal Rights Amendment definition"><span class="ndv">Equal Rights Amendment</span></a>, which would have given women the same rights and opportunities as men, failed to get the support of enough states to be passed. Later, however, several laws were passed making it illegal to <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/discriminate" title="discriminate definition"><span class="ndv">discriminate</span></a> against women. In Britain the <span class="eb">Human Rights Act</span> was passed in 1998, which stated that public organizations had to follow the principles listed in the <span class="eb">European Convention on Human Rights</span>.</span><span class="p">People in the UK and the US have always had a much valued <span class="eb">right to privacy</span>. However, the question of privacy has been called into question with the increasing popularity of social media websites like Facebook and Instagram. These companies gather people's personal information and sell it to other companies or use it for targeted advertising. Many people feel that this use of their personal information should not be allowed. Another worry people have is that government agencies such as the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/cia" title="CIA definition"><span class="ndv">CIA</span></a> in the US and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/gchq" title="GCHQ definition"><span class="ndv">GCHQ</span></a> in the UK collect huge amounts of data about people by tracking their internet history, their emails and their text messages. Governments defend these practices by saying that they are necessary to prevent <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/terrorism" title="terrorism definition"><span class="ndv">terrorism</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= the use of violence to achieve political aims)</span> and other serious crimes. Despite this, many people are still unhappy about such practices because they feel that their right to privacy is gradually being taken away. The US and British <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-freedom-of-information-act#the_freedom_of_information_act_topg_1" title="Freedom of Information Acts definition"><span class="ndv">Freedom of Information Acts</span></a></span> and the British <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-data-protection-act#the_data_protection_act_topg_1" title="Data Protection Act definition"><span class="ndv">Data Protection Act</span></a></span> allow a person access to information held about them and the opportunity to correct it if it is wrong.</span><span class="p">In the US several amendments to the Constitution deal specifically with the rights of people suspected or accused of a crime. In the UK recent changes to <span class="ndv" href="habeascorpus_d_1" tofix="" xt="andv">habeas corpus</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= the right of a person detained by the police to be released within 24 hours if not charged)</span> and <span class="eb">the right to remain silent</span> when arrested, which were introduced as part of the laws against <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/terrorism" title="terrorism definition"><span class="ndv">terrorism</span></a>, met with strong opposition from many people. If a person is suspected of terrorism it is possible for the police to keep them for 14 days before they are charged. In both the UK and the US the police are heavily criticized if people's rights are <span class="eb">infringed</span>.</span><span class="p">In the US people continue to disagree over an individual's right to own weapons. When this right was included in the Second Amendment, America had just finished fighting for <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/independence#independence_1" title="independence definition"><span class="ndv">independence</span></a>. Since the US did not want to keep a permanent army, its defence in the case of future attacks depended on ordinary people having weapons. Many people believe that, since the US now has a professional army, individuals do not need guns, and that the understanding of the amendment should take account of the modern situation. But others want to keep the right to have weapons and resist any changes to the law. This view is put forward especially by the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-national-rifle-association" title="National Rifle Association
