People like <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/jesse-james" title="Jesse James definition"><span class="ndv">Jesse James</span></a> became famous for leading gangs which committed crimes like <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/rob#rob_1" title="robbing definition"><span class="ndv">robbing</span></a> banks. People involved in organized crime, particularly during the 1920s and 1930s, were called <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/gangster" title="gangsters definition"><span class="ndv">gangsters</span></a></span>. The word <span class="ei">gang</span> is no longer used to refer to the group known as the <span class="ndv" href="mafia_d_1" tofix="" xt="andv">Mafia</span>, though members of the Mafia are often involved in <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/gangland" title="gangland definition"><span class="ndv">gangland</span></a> killings</span>. Gangs involved in organized criminal activity were less of a problem in Britain, though in the 1960s the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-kray-twins#the_kray_twins_topg_1" title="Kray twins definition"><span class="ndv">Kray twins</span></a> ran a gang in the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-east-end" title="East End definition"><span class="ndv">East End</span></a> of London and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/triad" title="triads definition"><span class="ndv">triads</span></a>, gangs similar to the Mafia, operate in some Chinese communities in Britain. Criminal gangs involved in <span class="eb">human <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/trafficking" title="trafficking definition"><span class="ndv">trafficking</span></a></span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= bringing people to the UK <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/illegally" title="illegally definition"><span class="ndv">illegally</span></a> and making them work for very little pay)</span> are an increasing problem.</span><span class="p">In Britain and the US <span class="ei">gang</span> now usually means a <span class="eb">street gang</span>, a group of young people in an <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/inner-city" title="inner-city definition"><span class="ndv">inner-city</span></a></span> area. Gangs have their own parts of the city and keep other gangs out of them. They may show which parts of the city they control by <span class="eb"><span class="ndv" href="tag_subentryg_2:tag_topg_3" tofix="">tagging</span></span>, <span class="ndv" href="spray_subentryg_2:spray_topg_3" tofix="">spraying</span> paint in particular designs on the walls in the area. People who belong to such gangs are called <span class="eb">gang members</span>. Crimes commonly associated with street gangs include selling drugs and, especially in the US, <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/drive-by#drive-by_1" title="drive-by definition"><span class="ndv">drive-by</span></a> shootings</span>, when they shoot a member of another gang while driving past, often injuring other people at the same time. In Britain violent crime related to <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/rival#rival_1" title="rival definition"><span class="ndv">rival</span></a> gangs, especially <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/stabbing#stabbing_1" title="stabbing definition"><span class="ndv">stabbing</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= injuring people with a knife)</span>, is increasing. In Britain in the 1960s and 1970s gangs of white <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/skinhead" title="skinheads definition"><span class="ndv">skinheads</span></a></span> caused fear among <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/ethnic-minority" title="ethnic minority definition"><span class="ndv">ethnic minority</span></a> groups. In recent years Asian and West Indian gangs have been established in places such as <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/london" title="London definition"><span class="ndv">London</span></a>, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/birmingham" title="Birmingham definition"><span class="ndv">Birmingham</span></a> and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/manchester" title="Manchester definition"><span class="ndv">Manchester</span></a>. Many of these gangs were formed originally to defend the local community, but then became involved in criminal activity. There are also football gangs, groups of supporters who attack fans of the opposing team at big matches, though this problem has become less serious in recent years.</span></span></span></div><span class="topic-g"><span class="prefix">Topics </span><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/topic/crime-and-punishment?level=c1" title="Topic crime-and-punishment"><span class="topic" href="l2:politics_and_society:crime_and_punishment?cefr=c1"><span class="topic_name">Crime and punishment</span><span class="topic_cefr">c1</span></span></a></span><div class="collapse" hclass="collapse" htag="div"><span class="unbox" id="gangster_unbox_2" unbox="snippet"><span class="box_title" onclick="toggle_active(this)">Oxford Collocations Dictionary</span><span class="body"><span class="p"><span class="eb">Gangster</span> is used before these nouns: <ul class="collocs_list"><li bord="n" class="li">film</li><li bord="n" class="li">movie</li></ul></span><span class="xref_to_full_entry">See <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/collocations/gangster" title=" definition in Collocations">full entry</a></span></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_gangster__gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_gangster__gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_gangster__us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_gangster__us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
