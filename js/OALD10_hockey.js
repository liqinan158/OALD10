<span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/field-hockey" title="field hockey definition"><span class="ndv">field hockey</span></a></span>. Hockey played on ice is called <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/ice-hockey" title="ice hockey definition"><span class="ndv">ice hockey</span></a></span>. In the US ice hockey is much more common and is called simply <span class="ei">hockey</span>. Both sports are played by both men and women.</span><span class="p">In field hockey there are 11 players in each team, five <span class="eb"><span class="ndv" href="forward_subentryg_3:forward_topg_5" tofix="">forwards</span></span>, three <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/half-back" title="half backs definition"><span class="ndv">half backs</span></a></span>, two <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/full-back" title="full backs definition"><span class="ndv">full backs</span></a></span> and a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/goalkeeper" title="goalkeeper definition"><span class="ndv">goalkeeper</span></a></span>. A <span class="eb">hockey pitch</span> (<span class="ei">NAmE</span> <span class="eb">hockey field</span>) is 100 yards/91 metres long and between 55 and 60 yards/50 and 55 metres wide. There is a <span class="eb">goal</span> at each end. The aim of the game is to hit a small white ball into the other team's goal with wooden <span class="eb">hockey sticks</span>. A goal is worth one point. Each game has two halves of 35 minutes. A game begins with a <span class="eb">pass-back</span>: a forward hits the ball but it is not allowed to cross the centre line until another player from either team has also hit it. There is also an indoor game of hockey played with six in each team.</span><span class="p">The modern game developed in England in the middle of the 19th century, and the first hockey club was formed in 1862. English clubs are now organized into a league with a <span class="eb">Premier Division</span> and three regional divisions. The Scottish Hockey Union runs leagues in Scotland. The sport is not shown on television as much as <span class="ndv" href="cricket_unbox_2" tofix="" xt="andv">cricket</span>, rugby or football and most people could not name any famous hockey players. In Britain ice hockey attracts relatively little interest.</span><span class="p">An English teacher visiting <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/harvard-university" title="Harvard University definition"><span class="ndv">Harvard University</span></a> introduced the sport to the US in 1901. At first it was played only by women, and the first men's game was not until 1928. In the US the game is controlled by the USA Field Hockey Association. It is less popular than in Britain.</span><span class="p">By contrast, ice hockey, first played in Canada, has long been popular in the US. It is a fast and exciting sport. Each team has six players, a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/centre#centre_1" title="centre definition"><span class="ndv">centre</span></a></span>, two <span class="eb">defensemen</span> and two <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/winger" title="wingers definition"><span class="ndv">wingers</span></a></span>, all of whom try to score, and a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/goaltender" title="goaltender definition"><span class="ndv">goaltender</span></a></span>.

The best teams in the <span class="eb">Eastern Conference</span> and the <span class="eb">Western Conference</span> play to decide which two will be in the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-stanley-cup#the_stanley_cup_topg_1" title="Stanley Cup definition"><span class="ndv">Stanley Cup</span></a>. The Hart Memorial Trophy is given to the best player, and Wayne Gretzky, thought by many to be the greatest ice hockey player ever, won it eight times in the period 1980-7 and in 1989.
