In the past, people who had no permanent home were called <span class="eb"><span class="ndv" href="tramp_subentryg_1:tramp_topg_2" tofix="">tramps</span></span> or <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/vagrant#vagrant_1" title="vagrants definition"><span class="ndv">vagrants</span></a></span>. Most were older people.

In Britain, the alternative to sleeping rough is to try to find a bed in a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/hostel" title="hostel definition"><span class="ndv">hostel</span></a></span> or <span class="eb">night <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/shelter#shelter_1" title="shelter definition"><span class="ndv">shelter</span></a></span>.</span><span class="p">In Britain, local councils are required by law to find somewhere for homeless families to live, and many families are housed in <span class="eb">bed-and-breakfast accommodation</span>. Charities such as <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/shelter#shelter_3" title="Shelter definition"><span class="ndv">Shelter</span></a>, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/centre-point" title="Centrepoint definition"><span class="ndv">Centrepoint</span></a> and the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-salvation-army" title="Salvation Army definition"><span class="ndv">Salvation Army</span></a> provide help and advice and run hostels for the homeless.

The US also has <span class="eb">shelters</span> but it is not easy to get a bed in one. Many do not have enough space, or have only enough money to stay open for part of the year. They are often away from the centre of town, people need to have money for the bus to get there and some homeless people do not feel safe in them.</span><span class="p">For many people, <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/homelessness" title="homelessness definition"><span class="ndv">homelessness</span></a></span> begins when they lose their jobs and cannot pay their rent. Some become homeless as a result of family arguments, broken relationships, violence, and mental illness. Some homeless people survive by <span class="eb">begging</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= asking for money)</span>. In Britain homeless people are able to make some money by selling <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-big-issue" title="The Big Issue definition"><span class="ndv">The Big Issue</span></a> magazine: they buy copies of the magazine and sell them at a higher, fixed price to members of the public. There are similar publications in the US, but they are less popular.</span><span class="p">Many people give to charities, or to homeless people on the streets, but some think they are responsible for their own situation. Americans generally believe that people should work hard to help themselves, instead of taking money from the government. For that reason, many Americans will give money to charities, but are opposed to a system of government benefits. But homeless people who have no address have difficulty getting the limited kinds of help available from the government.</span></span></span></div><span class="topic-g"><span class="prefix">Topics </span><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/topic/social-issues?level=c1" title="Topic social-issues"><span class="topic" href="l2:politics_and_society:social_issues?cefr=c1"><span class="topic_name">Social issues</span><span class="topic_cefr">c1</span></span></a></span></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_homelessness__gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_homelessness__gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_homelessness__us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_homelessness__us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
