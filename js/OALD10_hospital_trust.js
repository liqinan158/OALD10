The first <span class="dh">hospital trusts</span> were created in 1990, when the British government decided to make hospitals responsible for their own management and financial affairs. The idea was that they should be run on a more commercial basis, with less waste of money and resources. In 2004 the government introduced a new type of organization in England called the <span class="ei"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/foundation#foundation_sng_3" title="foundation definition"><span class="ndv">foundation</span></a> trust</span> or <span class="ei">foundation hospital</span>. Hospitals that achieve a high level of service can apply for <span class="ei">foundation status</span>, which gives them the right to raise their own finances, for example, by selling <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/asset" title="assets definition"><span class="ndv">assets</span></a> or borrowing money. The first twenty foundation trusts were created in April and July 2004. Many people are opposed to foundation hospitals because they believe they will create a situation where some hospitals have a lot of money and others not enough.</span></span></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_hospital_trust_1_gb_2" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_hospital_trust_1_gb_2.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_hospital_trust_1_us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_hospital_trust_1_us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
