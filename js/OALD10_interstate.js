Some country roads may be <span class="eb">single track</span> and only wide enough for one vehicle. In this case, there are <span class="eb">passing places</span>, where a vehicle can wait to let another through.</span><span class="p">In Britain the <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-highway-code" title="Highway Code definition"><span class="ndv">Highway Code</span></a></span> describes the many signs placed next to roads. Round red signs give instructions that must by law be obeyed. These include ‘no entry’ signs and signs about speed limits. Red triangle-shaped signs give warnings about possible dangers ahead, for example children crossing the road. Direction signs to major towns are blue on motorways and green on other roads; signs to smaller places are white. Old-fashioned <span class="eb"><span class="ndv" href="signpost_subentryg_1:signpost_topg_2" tofix="">signposts</span></span> can still be seen in some country areas.</span><span class="p">In the US red road signs, like ‘Stop’, must be obeyed. Signs that indicate danger, as in areas where rocks might fall, have a yellow diamond shape. Many other US road signs are now similar to those in Europe.</span><span class="p">In Britain there is pressure from both business and private road users for more and better roads, despite the damage to the environment and increase in pollution that this may cause. People who are against the building of new roads regularly challenge proposed routes of new motorways or bypasses.

Recently, experts too have questioned whether it is a good idea to build more roads, saying it simply encourages greater use of cars. In the US there are few protests against road-building. People generally want more roads to make their journeys faster and more convenient.</span></span></span></div><div class="collapse" hclass="collapse" htag="div"><span class="unbox" id="interstate3_unbox_3" unbox="extra_examples"><span class="box_title" onclick="toggle_active(this)">Extra Examples</span><ul class="examples" hclass="examples" htag="ul"><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_interstate__4"><span class="unx">an eleven-car pile-up on the interstate</span></li><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_interstate__5"><span class="unx">A motorist driving along the interstate saw the plane burst into flames.</span></li><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_interstate__6"><span class="unx">Speed limits are higher on some rural stretches of interstate highways.</span></li><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_interstate__7"><span class="unx">There has been an increase in traffic deaths on rural interstates.</span></li></ul></span></div><span class="topic-g"><span class="prefix">Topics </span><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/topic/transport-by-car-or-lorry?level=c1" title="Topic transport-by-car-or-lorry"><span class="topic" href="l2:travel:transport_by_car_or_lorry?cefr=c1"><span class="topic_name">Transport by car or lorry</span><span class="topic_cefr">c1</span></span></a></span><div class="collapse" hclass="collapse" htag="div"><span class="unbox" id="interstate3_unbox_4" unbox="snippet"><span class="box_title" onclick="toggle_active(this)">Oxford Collocations Dictionary</span><span class="body"><span class="unbox">adjective</span><ul class="collocs_list"><li class="li">major</li><li class="li">busy</li></ul><span class="unbox">verb + interstate</span><ul class="collocs_list"><li class="li">take</li><li class="li">get on</li><li class="li">get off</li><li class="li">…</li></ul><span class="unbox">preposition</span><ul class="collocs_list"><li class="li">along an/​the interstate</li><li class="li">down an/​the interstate</li><li class="li">on an/​the interstate</li><li class="li">…</li></ul><span class="xref_to_full_entry">See <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/collocations/interstate_1" title=" definition in Collocations">full entry</a></span></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_interstate__gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_interstate__gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_interstate__us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_interstate__us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
