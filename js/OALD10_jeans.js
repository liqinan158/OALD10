They are now worn all over the world. Jeans were created during the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/gold-rush" title="Gold Rush definition"><span class="ndv">Gold Rush</span></a> in the 1840s and 1850s, when many people went to the western US to search for gold. <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/miner" title="Miners definition"><span class="ndv">Miners</span></a> often lived in tents made out of a strong cloth and, because they needed strong clothes, they began to wear trousers made from the same cloth.

Black jeans, and <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/stonewashed" title="stonewashed definition"><span class="ndv">stonewashed</span></a></span> jeans that are made from denim which has been washed until it becomes lighter and softer, are also made. Many people feel comfortable in a pair of old jeans, even if they are torn at the knee. This has led to a fashion for '<span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/ripped" title="ripped definition"><span class="ndv">ripped</span></a></span>' jeans, which are already torn when they are sold.

Jeans were a symbol of these changes and became very popular. Now, people of any age wear jeans because they are comfortable, practical and relatively cheap. They can be made more or less formal, depending on what is worn with them, but some restaurants and bars which have a strict <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/dress-code" title="dress code definition"><span class="ndv">dress code</span></a> do not allow in people who are wearing jeans, and some companies do not like their staff to wear jeans for work.</span></span></span></div><span class="topic-g"><span class="prefix">Topics </span><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/topic/clothes-and-fashion?level=a1" title="Topic clothes-and-fashion"><span class="topic" href="l2:appearance:clothes_and_fashion?cefr=a1"><span class="topic_name">Clothes and Fashion</span><span class="topic_cefr">a1</span></span></a></span><div class="collapse" hclass="collapse" htag="div"><span class="unbox" id="jeans_unbox_2" unbox="snippet"><span class="box_title" onclick="toggle_active(this)">Oxford Collocations Dictionary</span><span class="body"><span class="unbox">adjective</span><ul class="collocs_list"><li class="li">skintight</li><li class="li">stretch</li><li class="li">tight</li><li class="li">…</li></ul><span class="unbox">… of jeans</span><ul class="collocs_list"><li class="li">pair</li></ul><span class="unbox">verb + jeans</span><ul class="collocs_list"><li class="li">pull on</li><li class="li">pull up</li><li class="li">pull off</li><li class="li">…</li></ul><span class="unbox">jeans + noun</span><ul class="collocs_list"><li class="li">pocket</li></ul><span class="xref_to_full_entry">See <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/collocations/jeans" title=" definition in Collocations">full entry</a></span></span></span></div><div class="collapse" hclass="collapse" htag="div"><span class="unbox" id="jeans_un_1" unbox="wordorigin"><span class="box_title" onclick="toggle_active(this)">Word Origin</span><span class="body"><span class="p">From <span class="eb">Janne</span>, the Old French name for Genoa, where the heavy cotton now used for jeans was first made.</span></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_jeans__gb_2" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_jeans__gb_2.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_jeans__us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_jeans__us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
