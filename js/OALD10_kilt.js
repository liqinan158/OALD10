Patterns depended originally on <span class="ndv" href="dye_subentryg_1:dye_topg_2" tofix="">dyes</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= colours)</span> available from local plants, so each area developed its own tartan.

From the late 18th century, Scottish <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/regiment" title="regiments definition"><span class="ndv">regiments</span></a> wore different tartans as an identifying feature, and the design of an individual tartan for each clan followed soon afterwards.

Men wear kilts when taking part in Scottish dancing displays or for formal occasions such as weddings.</span><span class="p">Many Scots consider it wrong to wear the tartan of a clan to which they do not belong, but this has not prevented tartan, or tartan-like patterns, becoming fashionable in Britain and abroad. For some people tartan has romantic associations with Scotland's history and its wild and beautiful countryside. Women's kilts, skirts and dresses, as well as <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/scarves" title="scarves definition"><span class="ndv">scarves</span></a>, bags, travelling <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/rug" title="rugs definition"><span class="ndv">rugs</span></a>, and many other articles, are made in tartan patterns. Goods sold to tourists, such as tins of <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/shortbread" title="shortbread definition"><span class="ndv">shortbread</span></a> biscuits, are decorated with tartan patterns to indicate their origin.</span></span></span></div><span class="topic-g"><span class="prefix">Topics </span><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/topic/clothes-and-fashion?level=c1" title="Topic clothes-and-fashion"><span class="topic" href="l2:appearance:clothes_and_fashion?cefr=c1"><span class="topic_name">Clothes and Fashion</span><span class="topic_cefr">c1</span></span></a></span><div class="collapse" hclass="collapse" htag="div"><span class="unbox" id="kilt_unbox_1" unbox="wordorigin"><span class="box_title" onclick="toggle_active(this)">Word Origin</span><span class="body"><span class="p">Middle English (as a verb in the sense ‘tuck up around the body’): of Scandinavian origin; compare with Danish <span class="ei">kilte (op)</span> ‘tuck (up)’ and Old Norse <span class="ei">kilting</span> ‘a skirt’.
