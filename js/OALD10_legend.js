Arthur gathered round him the best knights in the land, including Sir Lancelot , Lancelot's son <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/galahad" title="Sir Galahad definition"><span class="ndv">Sir Galahad</span></a>, Sir Bedivere and Sir Gawain, and established his court at <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/camelot" title="Camelot definition"><span class="ndv">Camelot</span></a>.

The knights went off in search of the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-holy-grail" title="Holy Grail definition"><span class="ndv">Holy Grail</span></a>. Lancelot saw but failed to obtain it because he was not pure enough, and it was eventually found by Sir Galahad. Arthur went to fight against Rome with Sir Gawain but while he was abroad, his sister's son Mordred took power and made Guinevere his prisoner. Arthur returned to England to defeat and kill Mordred at the battle of Camlan, but was himself seriously wounded. Morgan le Fay then appeared in a boat to take Arthur to <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/avalon" title="Avalon definition"><span class="ndv">Avalon</span></a>, the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/paradise" title="paradise definition"><span class="ndv">paradise</span></a> of the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/celt#celt_topg_1" title="Celts definition"><span class="ndv">Celts</span></a>.
