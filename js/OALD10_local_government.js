Wales is divided into 22 counties and <span class="eb">county boroughs</span> and Northern Ireland has 11 districts.

Most councillors belong to a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/political" title="political definition"><span class="ndv">political</span></a> party and, especially at county level, people often vote for them as representatives of a party, not as individuals. Since the Local Government Act of 2000, councils have been led by a <span class="eb">council leader</span> and a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/cabinet" title="cabinet definition"><span class="ndv">cabinet</span></a></span> of councillors, or a <span class="eb">directly elected mayor</span> and a cabinet.

Many people are employed by councils, but many services are also now carried out by private companies who are given contracts by the council. Councils receive some money from central government in the form of <span class="eb">grants</span>, they also collect <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/council-tax" title="council tax definition"><span class="ndv">council tax</span></a></span> from each household, a tax based on the value of the house.</span><span class="p">In the US, local government has three levels, with the <span class="eb">State government</span>, <span class="eb">County government</span> and below that, towns and cities.

The executive branch is headed by a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/governor" title="governor definition"><span class="ndv">governor</span></a></span> and state laws are made by a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/legislature" title="legislature definition"><span class="ndv">legislature</span></a></span>, which usually has two houses, a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/senate" title="Senate definition"><span class="ndv">Senate</span></a></span> and a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-house-of-representatives" title="House of Representatives definition"><span class="ndv">House of Representatives</span></a></span>. The judicial branch usually consists of a state <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-supreme-court" title="supreme court definition"><span class="ndv">supreme court</span></a> and several lower courts.

The structure of county government varies from state to state, but most countries have a <span class="eb">Board of <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/commissioner" title="Commissioners definition"><span class="ndv">Commissioners</span></a></span>, sometimes called a <span class="eb">Board of <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/supervisor" title="Supervisors definition"><span class="ndv">Supervisors</span></a></span>, with the Board and other county officials usually being elected. Services provided by a county government depend on the area, and whether it is mainly urban or rural. In urban areas, city and county governments may work together to provide services for the area. Counties usually have a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/sheriff" title="sheriff's definition"><span class="ndv">sheriff's</span></a> department</span>, a kind of police department, whose officers are called <span class="eb">sheriff's <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/deputy" title="deputies definition"><span class="ndv">deputies</span></a></span>.</span><span class="p">America's cities, towns and other <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/municipality" title="municipalities definition"><span class="ndv">municipalities</span></a> vary from small towns of a few hundred people to cities of millions. For that reason, there is no single system of local government. Most towns and cities have an elected <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/mayor" title="mayor definition"><span class="ndv">mayor</span></a> as their head and a council, made up of elected members from different areas of the city, which makes <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/ordinance" title="ordinances definition"><span class="ndv">ordinances</span></a></span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= local laws)</span>.
