The growth of the railway in the 1840s soon took business away from the canals, but the canal system played an important role in expanding trade and encouraging people to move west.</span><span class="p">After the railways were built, many canals were filled in. In Britain especially, canals that still exist have become popular with people wanting a quiet country holiday away from traffic. Old narrowboats have been fitted with motors and converted to provide attractive holiday accommodation. Speed is limited on canals so the pace is slow and relaxing. Some locks are operated by <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/lock-keeper" title="lock-keepers definition"><span class="ndv">lock-keepers</span></a></span>, but many are <span class="eb">worked</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= opened and closed)</span> by people on the boats. Going through a flight of locks is seen as part of the fun. At night, people <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/moor#moor_1" title="moor definition"><span class="ndv">moor</span></a> their boats at the side of the canal. Canals are also popular with people fishing and walking on the towpath. Many pubs are built next to canals and attract people enjoying a canal holiday or having a day out.</span><span class="p">In Britain, some people live in narrowboats and stay most of the time on a particular stretch of canal. These <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/houseboat" title="houseboats definition"><span class="ndv">houseboats</span></a></span> are often painted in bright colours, with pictures of flowers on the side. On the flat roof there are sometimes traditional pots painted with similar designs.</span></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_lock_keeper_1_gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_lock_keeper_1_gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_lock_keeper_1_us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_lock_keeper_1_us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
