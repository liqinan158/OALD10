For most people it is a chance to be at home with their family, play or watch sport, spend time on a hobby or go out somewhere. Both adults and children look forward to the freedom of the weekend and to having time to please themselves. On Friday people with jobs may go out for drink together after work. People who work, for example, in factories, shops, restaurants, hospitals and on public transport often have to work at weekends and instead get time off during the week. Sometimes people take an extra day off on Friday or Monday to make a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/long-weekend" title="long weekend definition"><span class="ndv">long weekend</span></a></span>. Several public holidays, such as <span class="ndv" href="memorialday_d_1" tofix="" xt="andv">Memorial Day</span> in the US and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/spring-bank-holiday" title="Spring Bank Holiday definition"><span class="ndv">Spring Bank Holiday</span></a> in Britain, are on a Monday in order to create a long weekend.</span><span class="p"><span class="eb">At the weekend</span> (<span class="ei">NAmE</span> <span class="eb">On the weekend</span>) people may do jobs around the house, look after their garden, wash the car, play or watch sport or watch television. The weekend is also the busiest time of the week for shopping. Shops are open on both Saturday and Sunday. For a long time many British people opposed <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/sunday-trading" title="Sunday trading definition"><span class="ndv">Sunday trading</span></a></span>, but there was pressure from some of the larger stores and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/diy" title="DIY definition"><span class="ndv">DIY</span></a> shops to be allowed to open, and now it is normal to shop on a Sunday.</span><span class="p">Friday and Saturday nights are popular, especially among young people, for parties and visits to clubs and pubs. People also go to the theatre or cinema, eat out at a restaurant, or invite friends to their house for dinner.</span><span class="p">On Sundays many people <span class="eb">have a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/lie-in#lie-in_2" title="lie-in definition"><span class="ndv">lie-in</span></a></span> (<span class="ei">NAmE</span> <span class="eb">sleep in</span>) <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= stay in bed longer than usual)</span>. Some people go to church on Sunday morning.

Brunch is eaten between about 10 and 12 in the morning and is enjoyed in a relaxed atmosphere. British people sometimes invite friends or family round for <span class="eb">Sunday lunch</span>. Many people go out for a walk or visit a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/theme-park" title="theme park definition"><span class="ndv">theme park</span></a>, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/stately-home" title="stately home definition"><span class="ndv">stately home</span></a> or other attraction, depending on their interests. In summer many families go out for the day to the countryside.</span></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_long_weekend_1_gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_long_weekend_1_gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_long_weekend_1_us_2" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_long_weekend_1_us_2.mp3"></audio>`;
