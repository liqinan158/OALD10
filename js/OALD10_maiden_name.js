Women often change their surname when they marry, replacing their <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/maiden-name" title="maiden name definition"><span class="ndv">maiden name</span></a></span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= the surname they had from birth)</span> with the surname of their husband. In the US especially, some women keep their maiden name as a middle name. Others choose to keep their maiden name as their surname after they are married. A few create a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/double-barrelled" title="double-barrelled definition"><span class="ndv">double-barrelled</span></a></span> name (<span class="ei">NAmE</span> <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/hyphenate" title="hyphenated definition"><span class="ndv">hyphenated</span></a></span> name) from the two surnames, such as Johnson-Brown. The husband and children may also take this name. In Britain a double-barrelled surname used to suggest an upper-class background, but now this is often not the case.</span><span class="p">In the US, laws about changing a last name, whether after marriage or for some other reason, vary from state to state, but it is usually a simple process and in some states people can just begin to use a new name if they want to. In Britain a woman can choose to change her surname after marriage. If people wish to change their name for any other reason they can do so by <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/deed-poll" title="deed poll definition"><span class="ndv">deed poll</span></a></span>, a simple legal procedure.</span><span class="p">In fact people rarely change their surname except after marriage, and many people are able to research their family history over many centuries. Most families were known by surnames by 1300 and many of the old names are still common. Sometimes the names reflected the place where the family lived, such as the name of their village or a reference to a feature of the local countryside, for example <span class="ei">Ford</span>, <span class="ei">Hill</span> or <span class="ei">Wood</span>. Other surnames refer to the original profession or trade of the family, for example <span class="ei">Baker</span>, <span class="ei">Miller</span>, <span class="ei">Shepherd</span> and <span class="ei">Smith</span>. Sometimes the surname began as a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/nickname#nickname_1" title="nickname definition"><span class="ndv">nickname</span></a>. For instance, someone with dark hair or dark skin might be called <span class="ei">Black</span>, <span class="ei">Blake</span> or <span class="ei">Brown</span>. Some surnames were taken from personal names, as in <span class="ei">Andrews</span>, <span class="ei">Martin</span> and <span class="ei">Roberts</span>. Others were based on French names that came to Britain during the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-norman-conquest#the_norman_conquest_topg_1" title="Norman Conquest definition"><span class="ndv">Norman Conquest</span></a>, for example, <span class="ei">Sinclair</span> from the French ‘Saint-Clair’.</span><span class="p">Many surnames occur throughout Britain, but others suggest a particular regional origin. Many Scottish names begin with <span class="ei">Mc-</span> or <span class="ei">Mac-</span>, meaning 'son of‘, for example, <span class="ei">McDonald</span> and <span class="ei">MacGregor</span>. Members of a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/clan" title="clan definition"><span class="ndv">clan</span></a> added this prefix to their father's name. Irish surnames often begin with <span class="ei">O'</span>, meaning ' <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/descend" title="descended definition"><span class="ndv">descended</span></a> from‘, for example, <span class="ei">O'Brien</span>. Many Irish surnames come from ancient <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/celtic#celtic_2" title="Celtic definition"><span class="ndv">Celtic</span></a> names. Common Welsh surnames include <span class="ei">Evans</span>, <span class="ei">Morgan</span>, <span class="ei">Price</span>, <span class="ei">Rees</span> and <span class="ei">Williams</span>. The most common surname in England and Scotland is <span class="ei">Smith</span>, closely followed by <span class="ei">Jones</span>, a name also widely found in Wales. Other surnames were brought to Britain by families from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and China. These include <span class="ei">Ahmed</span>, <span class="ei">Hussain</span>, <span class="ei">Khan</span>, <span class="ei">Patel</span>, <span class="ei">Singh</span> and <span class="ei">Tsang</span>.</span><span class="p">All the surnames found in Britain are also found in the US, together with many others from all over the world. Some people wanted to sound more American when they arrived in the US and so took English last names. Sometimes government officials could not understand the names of new arrivals and wrote similar English names on their documents. Many Americans of German origin changed their names during the two world wars. <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/african-american#african_american_topg_3" title="African Americans definition"><span class="ndv">African Americans</span></a> whose <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/ancestor" title="ancestors definition"><span class="ndv">ancestors</span></a> were slaves do not know what last names their families originally had. Many have English or Irish names, because slaves had to take the names of their owners.</span><span class="p">When British and American people introduce themselves they give their <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/first-name" title="first name definition"><span class="ndv">first name</span></a></span> and then their surname, for example, Michael Johnson, Linda Johnson. The opposite order 'Johnson, Michael‘ is used only in <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/alphabetical" title="alphabetical definition"><span class="ndv">alphabetical</span></a> lists. In informal situations people often give only their first name. When people are addressed in a formal way a title is put before their last name, usually <span class="eb">Mr</span> for men and <span class="eb">Mrs</span>, <span class="eb">Miss</span> or <span class="eb">Ms</span> for women. Married women used always to be called Mrs Johnson, etc. Women who were not married were known as Miss Johnson, etc. Many women now prefer the title <span class="ei">Ms</span> because, like <span class="ei">Mr</span>, it does not give any information about whether the person is married. Other titles include <span class="eb">Dr</span> for medical doctors and people with a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/doctorate" title="doctorate definition"><span class="ndv">doctorate</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= the highest university degree)</span> and <span class="eb">General</span>, <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/colonel" title="Colonel definition"><span class="ndv">Colonel</span></a></span>, etc. for people holding military ranks. People can be addressed as Dr Jones, Professor Roberts etc. or simply as Doctor (for a medical doctor) and Professor. Men especially may be referred to simply by their last name, for example, <span class="ei">the 44th president was Obama</span>, but addressing somebody in this way can seem old-fashioned or may cause offence.</span></span></span></div><span class="topic-g"><span class="prefix">Topics </span><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/topic/family-and-relationships?level=c1" title="Topic family-and-relationships"><span class="topic" href="l2:people:family_and_relationships?cefr=c1"><span class="topic_name">Family and relationships</span><span class="topic_cefr">c1</span></span></a></span></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_maiden_name_1_gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_maiden_name_1_gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_maiden_name_1_us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_maiden_name_1_us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
