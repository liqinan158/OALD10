In 1947, when the mines were <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/nationalize" title="nationalized definition"><span class="ndv">nationalized</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= brought under government control)</span>, there were still about 1 000 collieries and 700 000 miners.

By the middle of the 1980s there were only 160 collieries and 200 000 miners.

In the 1990s more mines were closed. In mining communities throughout Britain thousands of former miners struggled to find new jobs. Collieries returned to being owned by private companies in 1994, and most coal now produced in Britain is sold to the electricity-generating industry. </span><span class="p">The US is the world's second largest producer of coal and most is mined in the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-appalachian-mountains#the_appalachian_mountains_topg_1" title="Appalachian Mountains definition"><span class="ndv">Appalachian Mountains</span></a>.

Coal is used especially in the electricity-generating industry and in the making of steel. However, the industry is in decline and several of the largest mining companies have gone out of business since 2015 as electricity is increasingly generated in other ways.</span></span></span></div> <span class="xrefs" hclass="xrefs" htag="span" xt="see"><span class="prefix">see also</span> <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/data-mining" title="data mining definition"><span bord="y" class="xr-g" href="datamining_e"><span class="xh">data mining</span></span></a><span class="sep">,</span> <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/mine#mine_2" title="mine definition"><span bord="n" class="xr-g" href="mine_subentryg_2:mine_topg_3"><span class="xh">mine</span></span></a><span class="sep">,</span> <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/placer-mining" title="placer mining definition"><span bord="n" class="xr-g" href="placermining_e"><span class="xh">placer mining</span></span></a><span class="sep">,</span> <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/strip-mining" title="strip mining definition"><span bord="n" class="xr-g" href="stripmining_e"><span class="xh">strip mining</span></span></a></span><div class="collapse" hclass="collapse" htag="div"><span class="unbox" id="mining_unbox_2" unbox="snippet"><span class="box_title" onclick="toggle_active(this)">Oxford Collocations Dictionary</span><span class="body"><span class="p"><span class="eb">Mining</span> is used before these nouns: <ul class="collocs_list"><li bord="n" class="li">camp</li><li bord="n" class="li">community</li><li bord="n" class="li">conglomerate</li><li class="li">…</li></ul></span><span class="xref_to_full_entry">See <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/collocations/mining" title=" definition in Collocations">full entry</a></span></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_mining__gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_mining__gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_mining__us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_mining__us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
