After 50 years it had more than 46 000 miles/75 000 kilometres of road.

Since 1995 states have been able to set their own speed limits. This is usually between 65 amd 80 mph/105 and 128 kph on interstate roads but lower on other main roads.</span><span class="p">In Britain the fastest and most direct routes between major cities are by <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/motorway" title="motorways definition"><span class="ndv">motorways</span></a></span>, which usually have three lanes of traffic in each direction and a speed limit of 70 mph/112 kph. Each motorway is identified by the letter ‘M’ and a number.

Some country roads may be <span class="eb">single track</span> and only wide enough for one vehicle. In this case, there are <span class="eb">passing places</span>, where a vehicle can wait to let another through.</span><span class="p">In Britain the <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-highway-code" title="Highway Code definition"><span class="ndv">Highway Code</span></a></span> describes the many signs placed next to roads. Round red signs give instructions that must by law be obeyed. These include ‘no entry’ signs and signs about speed limits. Red triangle-shaped signs give warnings about possible dangers ahead, for example children crossing the road. Direction signs to major towns are blue on motorways and green on other roads; signs to smaller places are white. Old-fashioned <span class="eb"><span class="ndv" href="signpost_subentryg_1:signpost_topg_2" tofix="">signposts</span></span> can still be seen in some country areas.</span><span class="p">In the US red road signs, like ‘Stop’, must be obeyed. Signs that indicate danger, as in areas where rocks might fall, have a yellow diamond shape. Many other US road signs are now similar to those in Europe.</span><span class="p">In Britain there is pressure from both business and private road users for more and better roads, despite the damage to the environment and increase in pollution that this may cause. People who are against the building of new roads regularly challenge proposed routes of new motorways or bypasses. If they fail, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/environmentalist" title="environmentalists definition"><span class="ndv">environmentalists</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= people who care a lot about the environment)</span> may set up protest camps along the route of the new road. Recently, experts too have questioned whether it is a good idea to build more roads, saying it simply encourages greater use of cars. In the US there are few protests against road-building. People generally want more roads to make their journeys faster and more convenient.</span></span></span></div><div class="collapse" hclass="collapse" htag="div"><span class="unbox" id="motorway_unbox_3" unbox="extra_examples"><span class="box_title" onclick="toggle_active(this)">Extra Examples</span><ul class="examples" hclass="examples" htag="ul"><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_motorway__7"><span class="unx">He sang as he rattled down the motorway.</span></li><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_motorway__8"><span class="unx">She was driving along the motorway.</span></li><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_motorway__9"><span class="unx">We were on the motorway to London.</span></li><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_motorway__10"><span class="unx">the M25 London orbital motorway</span></li><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_motorway__11"><span class="unx">Five people were killed in a motorway pile-up.</span></li><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_motorway__12"><span class="unx">He doesn't like motorway driving.</span></li><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_motorway__13"><span class="unx">Motorway police stopped the van.</span></li><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_motorway__14"><span class="unx">The M25 motorway goes all the way around Greater London.</span></li><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_motorway__15"><span class="unx">The accident happened on a motorway slip road.</span></li><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_motorway__16"><span class="unx">The traffic on the motorway was solid.</span></li><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_motorway__17"><span class="unx">There are plans to build a new four-lane motorway.</span></li><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_motorway__18"><span class="unx">We stopped at a motorway service station.</span></li><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_motorway__19"><span class="unx">You can hear the roar of motorway traffic from here.</span></li></ul></span></div><span class="topic-g"><span class="prefix">Topics </span><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/topic/transport-by-car-or-lorry?level=a2" title="Topic transport-by-car-or-lorry"><span class="topic" href="l2:travel:transport_by_car_or_lorry?cefr=a2"><span class="topic_name">Transport by car or lorry</span><span class="topic_cefr">a2</span></span></a></span><div class="collapse" hclass="collapse" htag="div"><span class="unbox" id="motorway_unbox_4" unbox="snippet"><span class="box_title" onclick="toggle_active(this)">Oxford Collocations Dictionary</span><span class="body"><span class="unbox">adjective</span><ul class="collocs_list"><li class="li">busy</li><li class="li">four-lane</li><li class="li">three-lane</li><li class="li">…</li></ul><span class="unbox">verb + motorway</span><ul class="collocs_list"><li class="li">join</li><li class="li">leave</li><li class="li">turn off</li><li class="li">…</li></ul><span class="unbox">motorway + noun</span><ul class="collocs_list"><li class="li">driving</li><li class="li">traffic</li><li class="li">network</li><li class="li">…</li></ul><span class="unbox">preposition</span><ul class="collocs_list"><li class="li">along the motorway</li><li class="li">down the motorway</li><li class="li">up the motorway</li><li class="li">…</li></ul><span class="xref_to_full_entry">See <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/collocations/motorway" title=" definition in Collocations">full entry</a></span></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_motorway__gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_motorway__gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_motorway__us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_motorway__us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
