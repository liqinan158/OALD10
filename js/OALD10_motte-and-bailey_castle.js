When built, they were solid buildings with few comforts, designed for the defence of a town or region. About 1 200 castles were built in the 11th and 12th centuries, but the grandest were built when <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/edward-i#edward_i_topg_1" title="Edward I definition"><span class="ndv">Edward I</span></a> was king (1272–1307).

Many Scottish castles were built between the 13th and 17th centuries. They were <span class="eb">tower houses</span>, square buildings five or six floors high with small towers on top.</span><span class="p">Few castles are now lived in. Some are museums and contain valuable old furniture and weapons; others are <span class="ndv" href="ruin_subentryg_1:ruin_topg_2" tofix="">ruins</span>. Many are open to the public and are popular tourist attractions.</span><span class="p">The site for a castle was very important.
