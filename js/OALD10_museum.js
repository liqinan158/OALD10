The 80 000 objects collected by Sir Hans Sloane, for example, formed the core collection of the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-british-museum#the_british_museum_topg_1" title="British Museum definition"><span class="ndv">British Museum</span></a> which opened in 1759.</span><span class="p">The parts of a museum open to the public are called <span class="eb">galleries</span> or <span class="eb">rooms</span>.
