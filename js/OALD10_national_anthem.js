It is not known who wrote the words, but it seems that the song, said to be the oldest national anthem in the world, was written many years before it was chosen as an official national song in the 18th century. It was first performed in public in 1745, during the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-jacobite-rebellions" title="Jacobite rebellion definition"><span class="ndv">Jacobite rebellion</span></a>, to a musical arrangement by Thomas Arne (1710-78) .

It celebrates the existence of Welsh traditions, language and countryside and is often sung at concerts and at major sports events in which Wales is taking part.

From there he could watch the battle for control of Fort McHenry. The song tells how he watched as the sun went down. He could no longer see the fighting, but since bombs were still exploding he knew that the British had not won.
