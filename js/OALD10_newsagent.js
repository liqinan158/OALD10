They have <span class="ndv" href="editorial_subentryg_2:editorial_topg_3" tofix="">editorials</span> which comment on important issues and reflect the political views of the paper's <span class="eb">editor</span>.

They contain news of local events and sport, have advertisements for local businesses, and give details of houses, cars and other items for sale. Some are paid for by the advertisements they contain and are delivered free to people's homes.

Another section contains local news. The sport section is near the end of the paper, with the features section.

There are advertisements throughout the paper.</span><span class="p">US tabloids contain articles about famous people but do not report the news. They are displayed in supermarkets, and many people read them while they are waiting to pay.</span><span class="p">On Sundays in the US newspapers are thicker. There are usually fewer news stories but more articles analysing the news of the past week and many more features, including a colour section of comics.</span><span class="p">Newspapers get material from several sources. <span class="eb">Staff reporters</span> write about national or local news.
