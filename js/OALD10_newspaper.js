National <span class="eb"><span class="ndv" href="daily_subentryg_3:daily_topg_5" tofix="">dailies</span></span> are published each morning except Sunday. There is strong competition between them.

The quality papers report national and international news and are serious in tone. They have <span class="ndv" href="editorial_subentryg_2:editorial_topg_3" tofix="">editorials</span> which comment on important issues and reflect the political views of the paper's <span class="eb">editor</span>.

Another section contains local news. The sport section is near the end of the paper, with the features section.

There are advertisements throughout the paper.</span><span class="p">US tabloids contain articles about famous people but do not report the news. They are displayed in supermarkets, and many people read them while they are waiting to pay.</span><span class="p">On Sundays in the US newspapers are thicker. There are usually fewer news stories but more articles analysing the news of the past week and many more features, including a colour section of comics.</span><span class="p">Newspapers get material from several sources. <span class="eb">Staff reporters</span> write about national or local news.
