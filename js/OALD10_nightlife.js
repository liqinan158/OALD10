people do in the evening depends very much on where they live as well as on their tastes. In Britain Friday and Saturday evenings in most city centres are busy, with crowds of mainly young people moving between cinemas, pubs, clubs and bars. In rural areas people often go to the local pub but if they want more choice of entertainment they have to travel to a town. Similarly in the US, people living in New York have very different possibilities for a good <span class="eb">night out</span> compared with those living in small towns.</span><span class="p"><span class="eb">Pubs</span> in Britain attract a wide range of age groups. Older people tend to choose quieter pubs where conversation is easier than in the pubs and bars that are popular among younger people, where loud music is played. The main activity is drinking, usually beer or <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/lager" title="lager definition"><span class="ndv">lager</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= a type of pale light beer)</span>. People have to be over 18 to drink alcohol. Some pubs also have live music. <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/pub-crawl" title="Pub crawls definition"><span class="ndv">Pub crawls</span></a></span>, in which several pubs are visited in one evening, are popular with younger people. When pubs close people may look for something to eat or go to a <span class="eb">club</span>.</span><span class="p"><span class="eb">Bars</span> are often aimed at <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/trendy#trendy_1" title="trendy definition"><span class="ndv">trendy</span></a> young people, and <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/cocktail" title="cocktail definition"><span class="ndv">cocktail</span></a> bars</span> are usually smarter and more expensive. In the US <span class="eb">bars</span> range from those popular with students, where the drinks are cheap, to those in hotels where customers must dress smartly. <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/bartender" title="Bartenders definition"><span class="ndv">Bartenders</span></a></span> make hundreds of different drinks by combining various kinds of alcohol. The British <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/custom#custom_1" title="custom definition"><span class="ndv">custom</span></a> of buying a <span class="eb">round</span>, when each person in a group takes a turn to buy a drink for everyone else, is not always the rule in the US. Sometimes each person pays for his or her own drinks, or a group might <span class="eb">run a tab</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= the bartender writes down what they have)</span> and then everyone pays part of the bill when they leave. Some bars provide free <span class="ndv" href="snack_subentryg_1:snack_topg_2" tofix="">snacks</span>, especially during <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/happy-hour" title="happy hour definition"><span class="ndv">happy hour</span></a></span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= a time when drinks cost less)</span>. In the US people must be over 21 to drink alcohol. There are special alcohol-free bars for teenagers.</span><span class="p">A popular activity among young people is to <span class="eb">go clubbing</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= go to clubs to drink and dance)</span>. There is a charge to get in and drinks are usually more expensive than in pubs. Cities like New York and London are famous for their clubs. The music is usually modern dance music but some play <span class="ndv" href="soul_d_1" tofix="" xt="andv">soul</span>, jazz or pop.</span><span class="p">People living in or near a city or town can go to the <span class="eb">cinema</span> (<span class="ei">NAmE</span> <span class="eb">movie theater</span>) or <span class="eb">theatre</span> or to a <span class="eb">concert</span>.

In the US people occasionally go to <span class="eb">dinner theater</span>: they sit at tables in a theatre for a meal and stay there afterwards to watch a play.
