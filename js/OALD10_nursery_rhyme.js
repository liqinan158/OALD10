Some are more than 200 years old. An early collection of <span class="ndv" href="rhyme_subentryg_1:rhyme_topg_2" tofix="">rhymes</span>, <span class="ei">Mother Goose's Melody</span>, was published in England in about 1780 and in America five years later. <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/mother-goose" title="Mother Goose definition"><span class="ndv">Mother Goose</span></a> is herself a traditional figure who told stories and was later included in <span class="ndv" href="pantomime_unbox_2" tofix="" xt="andv">pantomime</span>.

The rhymes are popular because they are short, easy to say, and tell simple, often funny stories. For instance, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-queen-of-hearts" title="The Queen of Hearts definition"><span class="ndv">The Queen of Hearts</span></a> is about a queen who makes some <span class="ndv" href="tart_subentryg_1:tart_topg_2" tofix="">tarts</span> for the king, but somebody steals them and the king punishes the thief.</span><span class="p">Some nursery rhymes may refer to people or events in history. <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-grand-old-duke-of-york" title="The Grand Old Duke of York definition"><span class="ndv">The Grand Old Duke of York</span></a>, for instance, is supposed to be about the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-duke-of-york#thedukeofyork_hm3_ng_2" title="Duke of York definition"><span class="ndv">Duke of York</span></a>, a famous army leader, while <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/mary-mary-quite-contrary" title="Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary definition"><span class="ndv">Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary</span></a> may describe <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/mary-queen-of-scots" title="Mary, Queen of Scots definition"><span class="ndv">Mary, Queen of Scots</span></a>. <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/ring-a-ring-o-roses" title="Ring a Ring o' Roses definition"><span class="ndv">Ring a Ring o' Roses</span></a> may refer to the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-great-plague#the_great_plague_topg_1" title="Great Plague definition"><span class="ndv">Great Plague</span></a>: the <span class="ndv" href="rose_subentryg_1:rose_topg_2" tofix="">roses</span> are red spots on the skin and the last line, ‘We all fall down’, refers to people dying. Other rhymes are about country life and farm animals, such as sheep or <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/mice" title="mice definition"><span class="ndv">mice</span></a>. They include <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/baa-baa-black-sheep" title="Baa, Baa, Black Sheep definition"><span class="ndv">Baa, Baa, Black Sheep</span></a>, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/little-miss-muffet" title="Little Miss Muffet definition"><span class="ndv">Little Miss Muffet</span></a>, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/sing-a-song-of-sixpence" title="Sing a Song of Sixpence definition"><span class="ndv">Sing a Song of Sixpence</span></a> and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/three-blind-mice" title="Three Blind Mice definition"><span class="ndv">Three Blind Mice</span></a>.</span><span class="p">Rhymes such as <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/hush-a-bye-baby" title="Hush-a-bye, Baby definition"><span class="ndv">Hush-a-bye, Baby</span></a> are popular <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/lullaby" title="lullabies definition"><span class="ndv">lullabies</span></a></span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= songs that are sung to send children to sleep)</span>. Others teach a moral lesson or tell the story of an event: <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/humpty-dumpty" title="Humpty Dumpty definition"><span class="ndv">Humpty Dumpty</span></a>, for example, is an egg-shaped figure who breaks after falling off a wall and cannot be mended. Some rhymes have simple actions that go with them. Parents say the rhyme <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/this-little-pig-went-to-market" title="This little pig went to market definition"><span class="ndv">This little pig went to market</span></a> while pulling their children's toes. <span class="ei">Pat-a-Cake, Pat-a-Cake, Baker's Man</span>, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/oranges-and-lemons" title="Oranges and Lemons definition"><span class="ndv">Oranges and Lemons</span></a> and <span class="ei">Ring-a-Ring o' Roses</span> are all associated with simple games.

Since rhymes are usually spoken or sung there are often small differences in the words. For example, Americans say <span class="ei">Ring Around the Rosie</span> and <span class="ei">Pattie Cake, Pattie Cake, Baker's Man</span>. Nursery rhymes often refer to places or things that are unknown to most American children such as <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/st-ives" title="St Ives definition"><span class="ndv">St Ives</span></a> or <span class="ei">Banbury Cross</span>. Some rhymes use old or unusual language. For instance, Little Miss Muffet eats ‘ <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/curd" title="curds definition"><span class="ndv">curds</span></a> and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/whey" title="whey definition"><span class="ndv">whey</span></a>', and few people know that this is a kind of cheese. But none of these things really matter and nursery rhymes continue to be popular with young children everywhere.</span></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_nursery_rhyme_1_gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_nursery_rhyme_1_gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_nursery_rhyme_1_us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_nursery_rhyme_1_us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
