These limit where, when and by whom alcohol may be sold. In order to open a pub or bar the owner must obtain the approval of the local authority, which must be satisfied that he or she is a suitable person to sell alcohol. If the application is approved, the owner obtains a <span class="eb">licence</span> to sell alcohol and becomes the <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/licensee" title="licensee definition"><span class="ndv">licensee</span></a></span>.

Shops and supermarkets have to obtain a licence, before they can sell alcohol. Nobody under 18 is allowed to buy alcohol, either in a pub or in a shop.</span><span class="p">The 2003 Licensing Act removed many of the previous limits on opening hours. Pubs can stay open as long as they like on any day, if they have the appropriate licence, but they are only allowed to sell alcohol during official <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/opening-hours" title="opening hours definition"><span class="ndv">opening hours</span></a></span>.

In some places alcohol may not be sold on certain days, for example Sundays, or Christmas Day.</span><span class="p">The US has strict laws to try to keep young people from coming into contact with alcohol. The <span class="eb">drinking age</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= the age at which a person can buy alcohol)</span> is 21, and bars and liquor stores often ask customers for proof of age. In some places, people below 21 cannot work in, or even enter, bars or restaurants that serve alcohol. College students, especially, try to drink in bars by pretending to be older than they are. Young people who work in food shops may have to ask an older employee to serve a customer who wants to buy a bottle of wine. This is also the case in Britain.</span></span></span></div><span class="topic-g"><span class="prefix">Topics </span><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/topic/shopping?level=c2" title="Topic shopping"><span class="topic" href="l2:leisure:shopping?cefr=c2"><span class="topic_name">Shopping</span><span class="topic_cefr">c2</span></span></a></span></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_off_licence_1_gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_off_licence_1_gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_off_licence_1_us_3" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_off_licence_1_us_3.mp3"></audio>`;
