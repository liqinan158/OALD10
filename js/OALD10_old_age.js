In 2018 about 15% of the population of the US was over 65, in 2060 it will be about 24%. The number of people aged 65 and over in the UK is projected to increase from 18% of the population in 2016 to 25% in 2036. With further developments in medicine more and more people can expect to live a long time. This means that <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/senior-citizen" title="senior citizens definition"><span class="ndv">senior citizens</span></a></span> (<span class="ei">NAmE also</span> <span class="eb">seniors</span>) <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= people over about 65)</span> have become a more powerful group, but it also means that services for them need to improve. As people live longer, the question of how to pay for <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/retirement" title="retirement definition"><span class="ndv">retirement</span></a> has become an important social and political issue for governments. Many people need to work for longer. For people who have enough money from their pensions and who are in good health, the years of retirement may be an opportunity to do some of the things they did not have time for when they were working. Some people take courses, some go on more holidays/​vacations, others do <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/voluntary#voluntary_1" title="voluntary definition"><span class="ndv">voluntary</span></a> work</span> and continue to use the skills they learned for their job. Public transport, theatres, and sometimes restaurants give discounts to retired people. Senior citizens expect to be active, if their health permits. Many elderly people, however, have a more difficult old age. Those who rely on the British <span class="eb">state pension</span> or US <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/social-security" title="social security definition"><span class="ndv">social security</span></a></span> have to spend most of their money on food and heating and have little left for other things. Others have poor health and cannot move around easily. Some are afraid to go out and many are lonely.</span><span class="p">Older Americans who can afford a comfortable retirement may move to states like <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/florida" title="Florida definition"><span class="ndv">Florida</span></a> and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/arizona" title="Arizona definition"><span class="ndv">Arizona</span></a> where the weather is warm all year, the cost of living is lower and there are good facilities for older people. Many choose <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/assisted-living" title="assisted living definition"><span class="ndv">assisted living</span></a></span> in an apartment in a <span class="eb">retirement community</span>, where there is somebody close by to provide help if they need it. If they become ill they may need to move into a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/nursing-home" title="nursing home definition"><span class="ndv">nursing home</span></a></span> where they can get special medical care. Often the patient's husband or wife can live there too. The cost of nursing homes is very high, and while many are excellent, others are not good. A few older people live with their children, but Americans do not usually want to have to depend on their children.</span><span class="p">In Britain, too, elderly people like to be independent and to live in their own home for as long as possible. Those who find it difficult to look after themselves may have a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/home-help" title="home help definition"><span class="ndv">home help</span></a></span> for a few hours each week to help with work around the house, or a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/carer" title="carer definition"><span class="ndv">carer</span></a></span> who comes once or several times a day to help them with washing, dressing, etc. Some may use a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/meals-on-wheels" title="meals on wheels definition"><span class="ndv">meals on wheels</span></a></span> service. People who are less able to get about may be taken each day to a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/day-centre" title="day centre definition"><span class="ndv">day centre</span></a></span> run by organizations like <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/age-uk" title="Age UK definition"><span class="ndv">Age UK</span></a></span>, where they can be with other people. As in the US, some elderly people move into <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/sheltered-housing" title="sheltered housing definition"><span class="ndv">sheltered housing</span></a></span>, with a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/warden" title="warden definition"><span class="ndv">warden</span></a></span> available to help if needed. Others go to live with one of their children. Many families, however, do not have room for their elderly relatives or do not want them to live with them. When these people can no longer care for themselves they have to move into a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/care-home" title="care home definition"><span class="ndv">care home</span></a></span>.</span><span class="p">In Britain especially, elderly people get less respect than they do in many other societies. Names such as ‘wrinklies’, ‘old codgers’ or, for women, 'old biddies' are sometimes used to describe them in a cruel way. They used to be referred to as <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/old-age-pensioner" title="old-age pensioners definition"><span class="ndv">old-age pensioners</span></a></span> or <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/oap" title="OAPs definition"><span class="ndv">OAPs</span></a></span> but now the more positive ‘senior citizens’ is commonly used.</span></span></span></div><span class="topic-g"><span class="prefix">Topics </span><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/topic/life-stages?level=b1" title="Topic life-stages"><span class="topic" href="l2:people:life_stages?cefr=b1"><span class="topic_name">Life stages</span><span class="topic_cefr">b1</span></span></a></span><div class="collapse" hclass="collapse" htag="div"><span class="unbox" id="oldage_unbox_4" unbox="snippet"><span class="box_title" onclick="toggle_active(this)">Oxford Collocations Dictionary</span><span class="body"><span class="unbox">adjective</span><ul class="collocs_list"><li class="li">advanced</li><li class="li">extreme</li><li class="li">happy</li><li class="li">…</li></ul><span class="unbox">verb + old age</span><ul class="collocs_list"><li class="li">live to</li><li class="li">reach</li><li class="li">survive into</li><li class="li">…</li></ul><span class="unbox">old-age + noun</span><ul class="collocs_list"><li class="li">pension</li><li class="li">pensioner</li></ul><span class="unbox">preposition</span><ul class="collocs_list"><li class="li">in (your) old age </li><li class="li">into old age </li></ul><span class="unbox">phrases</span><ul class="collocs_list"><li class="li">the grand old age of something</li><li class="li">the ripe old age of something</li></ul><span class="xref_to_full_entry">See <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/collocations/old-age" title=" definition in Collocations">full entry</a></span></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_old_age_1_gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_old_age_1_gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_old_age_1_us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_old_age_1_us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
