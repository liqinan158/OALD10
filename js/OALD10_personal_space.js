The amount of space people need to feel around them is different in every culture, though British and American people have similar ideas about how much it should be. People from cultures that like a lot of personal space feel uncomfortable and embarrassed when somebody comes too close to them and try to move away; people who need less personal space are often offended when others seem to want to keep them at a distance.</span><span class="p">The amount of personal space people need also depends on several other factors. People of the same sex may sit or stand closer to each other than to somebody of the opposite sex. Strangers and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/acquaintance" title="acquaintances definition"><span class="ndv">acquaintances</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= people who don't know each other well)</span> usually need more space than friends and members of the same family who know each other well. But in a noisy street people may need to stand closer in order to hear each other, and in underground trains in the rush hour in London people have to stand very close together but they still try to respect each other's space as far as possible. Some British people avoid sitting next to strangers on buses and if there are lots of empty seats they choose one by itself.</span><span class="p">For a private conversation Americans need at least a foot/30 <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/centimetre" title="centimetres definition"><span class="ndv">centimetres</span></a> between each other, and British people more. Distances as great as 5 feet/1.5 metres may also seem comfortable. Standing too close to somebody when you are talking to them may be seen as threatening behaviour. Allowing somebody to get very close and enter your personal space may be a sign of trust or love.</span><span class="p">Older British people tend to avoid touching or being close to people outside their own family. Americans are only a little more comfortable about touching each other. When people meet for the first time they shake hands and sometimes let go quickly and move back. In formal situations they may also shake hands when they say goodbye. These days people are less worried about <span class="eb">keeping their distance</span>. People greet members of their family with a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/hug#hug_1" title="hug definition"><span class="ndv">hug</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= putting their arms round each other)</span> or kiss on one <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/cheek#cheek_1" title="cheek definition"><span class="ndv">cheek</span></a>, and may also greet friends in this way. They also hug and kiss each other when saying goodbye. Older men usually shake hands or simply <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/nod#nod_1" title="nod definition"><span class="ndv">nod</span></a> and smile. Younger men stand closer to shake hands; they also often hug each other and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/pat#pat_1" title="pat definition"><span class="ndv">pat</span></a> each other on the back at the same time.</span></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_personal_space_1_gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_personal_space_1_gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_personal_space_1_us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_personal_space_1_us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
