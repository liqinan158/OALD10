Some names come from a feature of the countryside. Others are named after a church or castle. Some honour famous people, while others have been brought from abroad.</span><span class="p">Many names reflect the history of an area and of the people who once lived there. Some of the oldest place names in Wales and Scotland date back to the time of the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/celt#celt_topg_1" title="Celts definition"><span class="ndv">Celts</span></a>. Some towns in Southern England have Latin names dating from <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/roman#roman_1" title="Roman definition"><span class="ndv">Roman</span></a> times. Other names are of <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/anglo-saxon#anglo-saxon_2" title="Anglo-Saxon definition"><span class="ndv">Anglo-Saxon</span></a> or <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/viking" title="Viking definition"><span class="ndv">Viking</span></a> origin and date from the period when these peoples entered Britain with their armies. Later, the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/norman#norman_topg_1" title="Normans definition"><span class="ndv">Normans</span></a> introduced some French names.</span><span class="p">In the US many place names come from <span class="ndv" href="nativeamerican_d_1" tofix="" xt="andv">Native American</span> words: <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/chicago" title="Chicago definition"><span class="ndv">Chicago</span></a>, for example, means 'place of the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/onion" title="onion definition"><span class="ndv">onion</span></a>' in the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/algonquian" title="Algonquian definition"><span class="ndv">Algonquian</span></a> language, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/seattle" title="Seattle definition"><span class="ndv">Seattle</span></a> is named after a chief, and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/natchez" title="Natchez definition"><span class="ndv">Natchez</span></a> after a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/tribe" title="tribe definition"><span class="ndv">tribe</span></a>. Sometimes the names were translated, sometimes not: the Black Warrior River in <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/alabama" title="Alabama definition"><span class="ndv">Alabama</span></a> runs through the city of Tuscaloosa, which was named after a Native American whose name means 'black <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/warrior" title="warrior definition"><span class="ndv">warrior</span></a>'. Names of Spanish origin are found mainly in the South-Western US. They include <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/san-francisco" title="San Francisco definition"><span class="ndv">San Francisco</span></a>, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/san-diego" title="San Diego definition"><span class="ndv">San Diego</span></a>, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/las-vegas" title="Las Vegas definition"><span class="ndv">Las Vegas</span></a> and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/los-angeles" title="Los Angeles definition"><span class="ndv">Los Angeles</span></a>. A few names are of French origin, for example, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/baton-rouge" title="Baton Rouge definition"><span class="ndv">Baton Rouge</span></a>. Some names come from more than one culture: Anaheim combines the Spanish name 'Ana' with the German 'heim' <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= home)</span>.</span><span class="p">Many British towns take their name from a river. In Wales and Scotland many towns have names beginning with <span class="ei">Aber-</span>, which means 'river mouth', for example, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/aberystwyth" title="Aberystwyth definition"><span class="ndv">Aberystwyth</span></a>, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/aberdeen" title="Aberdeen definition"><span class="ndv">Aberdeen</span></a>. In England towns close to a river mouth often end with <span class="ei">-mouth</span>, for example, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/dartmouth" title="Dartmouth definition"><span class="ndv">Dartmouth</span></a>. The name of the river forms the rest of the name. Names ending in <span class="ei">-ford</span> (<a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/oxford#oxford_2" title="Oxford definition"><span class="ndv">Oxford</span></a>) suggest a place where a river is shallow enough to cross. A town next to a lake may, in Scotland, contain <span class="ei">loch-</span> or, in England, <span class="ei">-mere</span>, for example, Lochinver, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/windermere" title="Windermere definition"><span class="ndv">Windermere</span></a>.</span><span class="p">In Scotland, there are several place names beginning with <span class="ei">Dun-</span>, meaning 'hill', for example, Dunbar. Any place whose name ends with <span class="ei">-don</span> (<a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/swindon" title="Swindon definition"><span class="ndv">Swindon</span></a>), <span class="ei">-hurst</span> (Sandhurst), <span class="ei">-head</span> (Gateshead) or, in Wales, begins with <span class="ei">pen-</span> (Penarth), probably stands on or near a hill. Towns near passes may end in <span class="ei">-gate</span>, for example, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/harrogate" title="Harrogate definition"><span class="ndv">Harrogate</span></a>, or, in Scotland, begin with <span class="ei">Glen-</span>, for example, Glencoe. Names ending with <span class="ei">-coumbe</span> or <span class="ei">-combe</span> (Ilfracombe) or <span class="ei">-dale</span> (Rochdale), or, in Wales, beginning with <span class="ei">cwm-</span> (Cwmbran) suggest that the town is in a valley.</span><span class="p">American place names based on natural features are easier to recognize. Examples include Two Rivers, River Edge, Mirror Lake, Ocean City, Gulf Breeze, Seven Hills, Shady Valley, Twentynine Palms, Lookout, Little Rock, Round Rock, White Rock and Slippery Rock. French names include La Fontaine and Eau Claire. Some place names describe a product, for example, Bean City, Copper City.</span><span class="p">Many British towns developed around an early <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/fort" title="fort definition"><span class="ndv">fort</span></a> or castle. This may be indicated by a name ending in <span class="ei">-burgh</span> (<a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/edinburgh" title="Edinburgh definition"><span class="ndv">Edinburgh</span></a>), <span class="ei">-bury</span> (<a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/salisbury" title="Salisbury definition"><span class="ndv">Salisbury</span></a>), <span class="ei">-caster</span> or <span class="ei">-cester</span> (<a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/doncaster" title="Doncaster definition"><span class="ndv">Doncaster</span></a>, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/gloucester" title="Gloucester definition"><span class="ndv">Gloucester</span></a>) or <span class="ei">-chester</span> (<a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/dorchester" title="Dorchester definition"><span class="ndv">Dorchester</span></a>), or beginning or ending with <span class="ei">castle</span> (<a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/newcastle" title="Newcastle definition"><span class="ndv">Newcastle</span></a>), or, in Wales, with <span class="ei">Caer-</span> (<a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/caernarfon" title="Caernarfon definition"><span class="ndv">Caernarfon</span></a>).</span><span class="p">Names that include <span class="ei">church-</span>, <span class="ei">kirk-</span> or, in Wales <span class="ei">llan-</span> refer to a church (Offchurch, Kirkby, Llandaff).

The elements <span class="ei">-ing</span> and <span class="ei">-ingham</span> at the end of a name mean 'people of' and 'home of the people of', as in <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/reading#reading_2" title="Reading definition"><span class="ndv">Reading</span></a> ('Read's people') and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/birmingham" title="Birmingham definition"><span class="ndv">Birmingham</span></a> ('home of Beorma's people').
