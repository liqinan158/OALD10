Later the phrase was often used in a negative way to refer to politically correct expressions that people thought were an unnecessary change. Some people doubt whether changing words will remove prejudice in people's minds or in the social system.</span><span class="p">In the 1960s and 1970s public debate caused many people to accept the principle that <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/discrimination" title="discrimination definition"><span class="ndv">discrimination</span></a></span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= treating some people worse than others)</span> is wrong. Changes of many kinds happened in schools and offices. History had been taught from the point of view of white people, but now more children learn about the history and culture of other groups in the community. In offices sexual and racial <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/harassment" title="harassment definition"><span class="ndv">harassment</span></a></span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= comments or behaviour intended to worry or upset somebody)</span> are not allowed.

However some language changes are much older than the PC movement. <span class="ei">Ms</span> has been used for a long time as a title for women who do not wish to identify themselves as being either married (<span class="ei">Mrs</span>) or single (<span class="ei">Miss</span>). Other PC expressions, for example, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/chair#chair_1" title="chair definition"><span class="ndv">chair</span></a> or <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/chairperson" title="chairperson definition"><span class="ndv">chairperson</span></a> instead of <span class="ei">chairman</span>, are also common. Changes in the US include saying <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/native-american#native-american_2" title="Native American definition"><span class="ndv">Native American</span></a> instead of <span class="ei">Indian</span>, although <span class="ei">American Indian</span> is accepted by some people, and using the term <span class="ei">people of color</span> to refer to people who are not white.</span><span class="p">Words relating to disabilities, such as <span class="ei">blind</span> and <span class="ei">deaf</span> are replaced by less direct terms such as <span class="ei">visually impaired</span> and <span class="ei">hearing impaired</span> in formal contexts. Many jobs have also been given PC names, particularly by organizations who want to make a job seem more attractive to people who are looking for work, for example, <span class="ei">refuse collector</span> (dustman) or <span class="ei">domestic hygiene assistant</span> (cleaner). Some PC terms are used <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/humorously" title="humorously definition"><span class="ndv">humorously</span></a>, for example,<span class="ei">vertically challenged</span> (short) or <span class="ei">intellectually challenged</span> (stupid). PC terms which have not been widely used or accepted include <span class="ei">differently sized</span> (fat) and <span class="ei">involuntarily leisured</span> (unemployed). People who are against the idea of political correctness use examples like these to suggest that the idea of changing language in order to change people's attitudes is silly.</span></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_political_correctness_1_gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_political_correctness_1_gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_political_correctness_1_us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_political_correctness_1_us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
