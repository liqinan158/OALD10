The <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/post-office" title="Post Office definition"><span class="ndv">Post Office</span></a></span> manages the country's many post offices. The Royal Mail is a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/private-limited-company" title="private limited company definition"><span class="ndv">private limited company</span></a>, having been sold by the government in 2013. As well as selling stamps, post offices take in letters and packages that are to be sent by <span class="eb">special delivery</span>. They also offer foreign currency exchange. Small post offices are now often based in a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/newsagent" title="newsagent's definition"><span class="ndv">newsagent's</span></a> or other shop, rather than being in a separate building. In recent years, many smaller post offices have been closed because they do not make a profit, though this has led to protests from local people.</span><span class="p"><span class="eb">Mail</span> is often called <span class="eb">post</span> in British English. When sending a letter, people can choose between two levels of service, <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/first-class#first-class_2" title="first class definition"><span class="ndv">first class</span></a></span> or the cheaper <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/second-class#second-class_1" title="second class definition"><span class="ndv">second class</span></a></span>. Normally, first-class mail is delivered the day after it is posted and second-class mail within two or three days. Every address in Britain includes a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/postcode" title="postcode definition"><span class="ndv">postcode</span></a></span> of letters and numbers, for example OX2 6DP for an address in <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/oxford#oxford_2" title="Oxford definition"><span class="ndv">Oxford</span></a>, that makes it possible to sort the post by machine. Letters are posted in red <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/postbox" title="postboxes definition"><span class="ndv">postboxes</span></a></span>, also called <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/letter-box" title="letter boxes definition"><span class="ndv">letter boxes</span></a></span>. Each has a sign giving times of <span class="eb">collections</span>. <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/postman" title="Postmen definition"><span class="ndv">Postmen</span></a></span> and <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/postwoman" title="postwomen definition"><span class="ndv">postwomen</span></a></span> deliver mail Monday to Saturday direct to homes and businesses. They put the mail through a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/flap#flap_1" title="flap definition"><span class="ndv">flap</span></a> in the door, which is also called a <span class="eb">letter box</span>. In rural areas they travel round in red vans, but in towns and villages they usually go from house to house on foot or on bicycles.</span><span class="p">The system that deals with mail in the US, the <span class="eb">US Postal Service</span> (<span class="eb">USPS</span>), is an independent part of the government. Its head is the <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/postmaster-general" title="Postmaster General definition"><span class="ndv">Postmaster General</span></a></span>. <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/mail-carrier" title="Mail carriers definition"><span class="ndv">Mail carriers</span></a></span>, sometimes called <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/mailman" title="mailmen definition"><span class="ndv">mailmen</span></a></span> or <span class="eb">mailwomen</span>, deliver mail to homes and businesses once a day, Monday to Saturday. Most homes have <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/mailbox" title="mailboxes definition"><span class="ndv">mailboxes</span></a></span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= small boxes where letters can be put)</span> fixed outside, near the door. It is very unusual for a house to have a letter box in the door for letters. People whose houses are a long way from the road have a special <span class="eb">rural mailbox</span> by the road for mail to be delivered to. The mailbox has a flag which is raised to let the mail carrier know when there is mail inside to be collected for sending. In cities and towns letters to be sent are posted in one of the many blue mailboxes. Every address in the US includes an abbreviation for the name of the state and a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/zip-code" title="ZIP code definition"><span class="ndv">ZIP code</span></a></span>, which is used to help sort the mail. Post offices sell stamps and deal with mail that has to be <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/insured" title="insured definition"><span class="ndv">insured</span></a>. Most cities have one post office which stays open late. Americans complain about the Postal Service, but it usually does an efficient job at a reasonable price.</span><span class="p">In the US only the Postal Service can deliver mail to letter boxes and the Service has a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/monopoly" title="monopoly definition"><span class="ndv">monopoly</span></a> on first-class mail that is not <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/urgent" title="urgent definition"><span class="ndv">urgent</span></a>. In Britain the post office does not have a monopoly on delivery of post. In both countries there are many companies who provide <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/courier#courier_1" title="courier definition"><span class="ndv">courier</span></a></span> and <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/messenger" title="messenger definition"><span class="ndv">messenger</span></a></span> services for urgent mail. The largest of these include <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/fedex" title="FedEx definition"><span class="ndv">FedEx</span></a> and DHL. In Britain private companies may also deliver mail to letter boxes.</span></span></span></div></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_postal_service_1_gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_postal_service_1_gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_postal_service_1_us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_postal_service_1_us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
