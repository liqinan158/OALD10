Groups that work for a section of society are sometimes called <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/interest-group" title="interest groups definition"><span class="ndv">interest groups</span></a></span>. Those that work for a particular cause are known as <span class="eb">promotional groups</span> or simply pressure groups. These pressure groups operate in a similar way in Britain and in the US.</span><span class="p">There are several types of interest groups. <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/trade-union" title="Trade unions definition"><span class="ndv">Trade unions</span></a></span> and <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/labor-union" title="labor unions definition"><span class="ndv">labor unions</span></a></span> represent workers in industry and are mostly concerned with their wages and health, safety, etc. <span class="eb">Professional bodies</span> such as the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-bma" title="BMA definition"><span class="ndv">BMA</span></a> (British Medical Association) are similar to trade unions and the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/cbi" title="CBI definition"><span class="ndv">CBI</span></a> (Confederation of British Industry) represents the interests of employers. In Britain several <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/watchdog" title="watchdogs definition"><span class="ndv">watchdogs</span></a></span> have been established by Act of Parliament to monitor certain industries, for example, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/ofgem" title="Ofgem definition"><span class="ndv">Ofgem</span></a>, which watches the gas and electricity industries for the benefit of users. Many promotional groups are linked to <span class="eb">charities</span>. Since charities are not allowed to take part in party political activity, many set up a related organization to act as a pressure group. In the US many pressure groups form <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/political-action-committee" title="political action committees definition"><span class="ndv">political action committees</span></a></span> which are allowed to give money to political campaigns. Well-known promotional groups include <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-friends-of-the-earth#the_friends_of_the_earth_topg_1" title="Friends of the Earth definition"><span class="ndv">Friends of the Earth</span></a> and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/amnesty-international" title="Amnesty International definition"><span class="ndv">Amnesty International</span></a>. There are also many smaller groups, usually less permanent, which are formed to protest about local issues.</span><span class="p">Pressure groups aim to influence the government to the benefit of their members or the cause they support. They may draw attention to problems by asking people to sign a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/petition#petition_1" title="petition definition"><span class="ndv">petition</span></a></span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= a formal request signed by many people)</span>, often online, by giving media interviews, or by organizing <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/demonstration" title="demonstrations definition"><span class="ndv">demonstrations</span></a></span> that will attract public and media attention. Many groups try to get the support of well-known people such as pop stars. They also try to persuade politicians to support their cause and to speak about it in Parliament or <span class="ndv" href="congress_d_1" tofix="" xt="andv">Congress</span>, a practice known as <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/lobby#lobby_sng_5" title="lobbying definition"><span class="ndv">lobbying</span></a></span>. Government departments may talk to pressure groups when changes to the law are being considered. There are some groups that are ready to break the law in order to achieve their aims.</span></span></span></div><span class="topic-g"><span class="prefix">Topics </span><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/topic/politics?level=c2" title="Topic politics"><span class="topic" href="l2:politics_and_society:politics?cefr=c2"><span class="topic_name">Politics</span><span class="topic_cefr">c2</span></span></a></span></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_pressure_group_1_gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_pressure_group_1_gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_pressure_group_1_us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_pressure_group_1_us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
