onclick="toggle_active(this)">Culture <span class="closed">privacy</span></span><span class="body"><span class="unbox">privacy</span><span class="p">People in Britain and the US value their <span class="eb">privacy</span> and believe that everyone has a right to a <span class="eb">private life</span>. British people in particular generally like to ‘keep themselves to themselves’ and do not discuss their private affairs. Things people like to keep private vary but may include personal relationships, family problems, how much they earn, their health, their political opinions, and sometimes what they do in their free time. It can be considered rude to ask somebody about certain aspects of their private life, even if you know them well. However, people are becoming aware that avoiding discussion of issues such as sexual identity and mental health can be damaging. As a result people have begun to be more open about their private lives.</span><span class="p">People in Britain and the US have always had a much valued <span class="eb">right to privacy</span>. However, the question of privacy has been called into question with the increasing popularity of social media websites like Facebook and Instagram. These companies gather people's personal information and sell it to other companies or use it for targeted advertising. Many people feel that this use of their personal information should not be allowed. Another worry people have is that government agencies such as the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/cia" title="CIA definition"><span class="ndv">CIA</span></a> in the US and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/gchq" title="GCHQ definition"><span class="ndv">GCHQ</span></a> in Britain collect huge amounts of data about people by tracking their internet history, their emails and their text messages. Governments defend these practices by saying that they are necessary to prevent <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/terrorism" title="terrorism definition"><span class="ndv">terrorism</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= the use of violence to achieve political aims)</span> and other serious crimes. Despite this, many people are still unhappy about such practices because they feel that their right to privacy is gradually being taken away.</span><span class="p">In the US the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/constitution" title="Constitution definition"><span class="ndv">Constitution</span></a> is meant to protect people's right to privacy. A police officer has no power to stop people and ask them what they are doing unless they have committed a crime. Information about people can be shown to others only under special circumstances, and usually only with their permission. When newspapers print details about the family life of a politician or film actor they are often criticized for <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/invasion" title="invasion definition"><span class="ndv">invasion</span></a> of privacy</span>. On the other hand, actors and politicians tell the press about their family life for <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/publicity" title="publicity definition"><span class="ndv">publicity</span></a> reasons, and ordinary Americans appear on television talk shows where they discuss their bad marriages, health problems and how they cannot control their children. The apparent <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/contradiction" title="contradiction definition"><span class="ndv">contradiction</span></a> in attitudes may be explained by the fact that Americans believe strongly in the right to privacy, but as long as that right is respected, they are happy to talk about private matters on their own terms. They believe it is better to be open and honest than to have secrets. The British are, generally, less willing than Americans to talk about their own lives but they too have what they consider to be 'American-style' television shows in which members of the public discuss their relationship problems. The British have an equally strong desire to know about the private lives of famous people. There is a constant argument, for instance, about the extent to which the media should be allowed to report the private lives of members of the royal family or of celebrities and other public figures. The press has been strongly criticized for <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/phone-hacking" title="phone hacking definition"><span class="ndv">phone hacking</span></a></span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= listening to people's phone conversations without permission)</span>.</span><span class="p">Americans don't tell the world everything about their lives. Money and sex are rarely discussed. Husbands and wives usually know how much each other earns, but other family members do not. People may say how much they paid for something, but in general people don't ask somebody else how much they paid. People are usually happier offering information than being asked for it.</span><span class="p">Being given advice can also damage an American's sense of privacy because it seems to suggest that somebody else thinks they can solve your problem better than you can yourself. When offering advice, people use indirect language, and instead of saying, ‘You should do this,’ they may say, ‘I tried doing this, and it worked for me’.</span></span></span></div></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_privacy__gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_privacy__gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_privacy__us_2" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_privacy__us_2.mp3"></audio>`;
