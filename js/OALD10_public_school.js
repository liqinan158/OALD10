Most public schools were single-sex schools but many now teach girls and boys together.

Some people send their children to public school mainly for this reason; others believe public schools provide a better education than state schools.

Schools that students have to pay to attend are called <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/private-school" title="private schools definition"><span class="ndv">private schools</span></a></span>. There are many private schools in the US, some of which are boarding schools. Some, like Phillips Exeter Academy and the Bath Academy, are very similar to the UK's public schools. They are very expensive, have a good reputation, and many of their students come from rich and well-known families. Children often go to the same school as their parents. Many of the most famous schools of this sort are in <span class="ndv" href="newengland_d_1" tofix="" xt="andv">New England</span>.</span><span class="p">Some US private schools give special attention to a particular area of study. There are, for example, schools for people who are good at music or art. Military schools are often chosen by parents who are in the armed forces, or who think their children need a lot of discipline. Religious groups also run private schools, although not all of the students who attend practise that religion. Schools run by the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/catholic#catholic_2" title="Catholic definition"><span class="ndv">Catholic</span></a> church are called <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/parochial-school" title="parochial schools definition"><span class="ndv">parochial schools</span></a></span>.</span><span class="p">Private schools in the US are often single-sex and their students usually wear a uniform. This is unusual in the US. Parents choose a private school for their children for a number of reasons, but in general they believe that the quality of education is higher in private schools, and there is some evidence to support this. Most private schools offer scholarships to students from poorer families, and in some parts of the US the government may under certain circumstances pay for children to attend a private school.</span></span></span></div></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_public_school_1_gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_public_school_1_gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_public_school_1_us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_public_school_1_us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
