Elsewhere, most Americans prefer to use their cars. Families often have two cars and, outside major cities, have to drive fairly long distances to schools, offices, shops, banks, etc. Many college and even <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/high-school" title="high school definition"><span class="ndv">high school</span></a> students have their own cars.</span><span class="p">Long-distance travel in Britain is also mainly by road, though railways link most towns and cities. Most places are linked by <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/motorway#motorway_topg_1" title="motorways definition"><span class="ndv">motorways</span></a> or other fast roads and many people prefer to travel by car at a time of their choice rather than use a train, even though they may get stuck in a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/traffic-jam" title="traffic jam definition"><span class="ndv">traffic jam</span></a>. Long-distance <span class="eb">coach</span> services are usually a cheaper alternative to trains, but they take longer and may be less comfortable. Some long-distance travel, especially business travel, may be by air. There are regular flights between regional airports, as well as to and from London.

Other private railroad companies such as <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/union-pacific-railroad" title="Union Pacific Railroad definition"><span class="ndv">Union Pacific Railroad</span></a> now carry only <span class="ndv" href="freight_subentryg_1:freight_topg_2" tofix="">freight</span>, though in fact a large percentage of freight goes by road.</span><span class="p">The main problems associated with road transport in both Britain and the US are <span class="eb">traffic <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/congestion#congestion_sng_1" title="congestion definition"><span class="ndv">congestion</span></a></span> and <span class="eb">pollution</span>. In London, a system of <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/congestion-charging" title="congestion charging definition"><span class="ndv">congestion charging</span></a> has been introduced. The British government would like more people to use public transport, but so far they have had little success in persuading people to give up their cars or to share rides with neighbours. Nevertheless, travel by train is increasing. Most people feel that public transport needs to be improved. Americans have resisted government requests to share cars because it is less convenient and limits their freedom. Fuel is relatively cheap in the US and outside the major cities public transportation is bad, so they see no reason to use their cars less.</span><span class="p">Despite the use of <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/unleaded#unleaded_2" title="unleaded definition"><span class="ndv">unleaded</span></a> petrol/​gasoline, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/exhaust#exhaust_sng_1" title="exhaust definition"><span class="ndv">exhaust</span></a> <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/emission#emission_sng_2" title="emissions definition"><span class="ndv">emissions</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= gases)</span> from vehicles still cause air pollution which can have serious effects on health. In the past, people were encouraged to buy <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/diesel#diesel_sng_1" title="diesel definition"><span class="ndv">diesel</span></a> cars because they use less fuel and produce less <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/carbon-dioxide" title="carbon dioxide definition"><span class="ndv">carbon dioxide</span></a>. However it has now been found that diesel cars cause more of other kinds of pollution, and some cities are considering banning older diesel cars.The US was the first nation to require cars to be fitted with <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/catalytic-converter" title="catalytic converters definition"><span class="ndv">catalytic converters</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= devices that reduce the amount of dangerous gases given off)</span>. Emissions are required to be below a certain level, and devices have been developed to check at the side of the road that vehicles meet the requirement. Stricter controls are also being applied to lorries. Car makers are developing cars that use electricity and other fuels that cause less pollution.</span><span class="p">The cheapest and most <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/environmentally-friendly" title="environmentally-friendly definition"><span class="ndv">environmentally-friendly</span></a> ways to travel are to walk or ride a bicycle.
