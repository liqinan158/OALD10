Arriving <span class="eb">on time</span> for formal events such as a business meeting or an interview is considered important. Many people try to arrive a few minutes early for an appointment to avoid the risk of rushing in at the last minute. Even in less formal situations people are generally expected to think about the person they are meeting and not to keep them waiting.</span><span class="p">People are also expected to arrive on time for social events, especially weddings. According to tradition, only the bride is allowed to be late. People are generally more relaxed about the time they arrive for more informal social occasions. When meeting a friend for lunch at a restaurant, people try to arrive at the time arranged, or no more than five minutes late. If they are later than this the person they are meeting will start to think they are not going to come at all. However, when invited to dinner in somebody's home it is actually considered polite to arrive a few minutes late. Under no circumstances should guests arrive early. Some formal invitations to dinner may say ‘seven for seven-thirty’, meaning that guests should arrive any time after 7 p.m. in order to be ready to eat at 7.30 p.m. At a party, however, people may arrive an hour or more after the start time written on the invitation.</span><span class="p">If somebody does arrive late, they are expected to apologize. Depending on the circumstances and how late they are, people may say, ‘I'm sorry I'm late’ or ‘Sorry to keep you waiting’. If they are very late they may feel they need to to give an explanation as well, for example, ‘I'm sorry I'm so late, but the traffic was bad.’</span><span class="p">People expect concerts, plays etc. to start at the time advertised, and if they are kept waiting a long time they may start a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/slow-handclap" title="slow handclap definition"><span class="ndv">slow handclap</span></a> to show that they are impatient. Anyone who arrives late for a show may not be allowed in until there is a convenient break in the performance. People also expect public transport to leave and arrive on time (although it often doesn't), and they get annoyed if delays happen frequently. Many people do not like to feel that their time is being wasted and that they are being kept waiting without good reason.</span></span></span></div><div class="collapse" hclass="collapse" htag="div"><span class="unbox" id="punctual_unbox_2" unbox="wordorigin"><span class="box_title" onclick="toggle_active(this)">Word Origin</span><span class="body"><span class="p">late 17th cent.: from medieval Latin <span class="ei">punctualis</span>, from Latin <span class="ei">punctum</span> ‘a point’.</span></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_punctual__gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_punctual__gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_punctual__us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_punctual__us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
