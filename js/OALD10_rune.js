The most famous of these is <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/beowulf" title="Beowulf definition"><span class="ndv">Beowulf</span></a>, created by an unknown author and written down in the 8th or 9th century. <span class="ei">Beowulf</span> is set in 5th-century <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/scandinavia" title="Scandinavia definition"><span class="ndv">Scandinavia</span></a> and tells the story of the hero Beowulf's battles with the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/monster#monster_1" title="monster definition"><span class="ndv">monster</span></a> Grendel and Grendel's mother.</span><span class="p">To modern British people Old English looks at first like a foreign language. It was originally written in <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/rune" title="runes definition"><span class="ndv">runes</span></a></span> or <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/runic" title="runic definition"><span class="ndv">runic</span></a> letters</span>, an ancient <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/alphabet" title="alphabet definition"><span class="ndv">alphabet</span></a> of 24 <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/angular" title="angular definition"><span class="ndv">angular</span></a> letters, and then in a form of the Roman alphabet that included several of these letters, such as the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/thorn" title="thorn definition"><span class="ndv">thorn</span></a> (þ) for ‘th’, both voiced <span class="eph"><span class="wrap">/</span>ð<span class="wrap">/</span></span> and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/voiceless" title="voiceless definition"><span class="ndv">voiceless</span></a> <span class="eph"><span class="wrap">/</span>θ<span class="wrap">/</span></span>, and the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/ash#ash_1" title="ash definition"><span class="ndv">ash</span></a> (æ). Some Old English words, such as <span class="ei">dead</span>, <span class="ei">is</span>, <span class="ei">brother</span> and <span class="ei">and</span> in the following passage from Beowulf, have survived with little change into modern English. Some words become easier to recognize when they are translated, for example <span class="ei">yldra</span> meaning ‘older’ and <span class="ei">min</span> for ‘my’, whereas others are completely foreign to us. Word order is also different from modern English.</span><span class="blockquote"><span class="p-g"><span class="wrap_open">“</span><span class="p">Hroðgar maþelode, helm Scyldinga:</span><span class="p">‘Ne frin þu æfter sælum!
