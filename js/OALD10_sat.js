Standardized tests often do not test how much people know about a subject, but how strong their skills are in areas like reading and solving problems. People do not pass or fail but instead each college or university decides on the lowest score it will accept. Test scores are never the only factor to be considered in deciding whether to offer a place to a student.</span><span class="p">Some professions require people to pass special exams before they are qualified to practise. Lawyers in the US, for example, must pass the <span class="eb">bar exam</span> in the state in which they wish to work, to show that they know the laws of that state.</span></span></span></div> </li></ol></div><div class="entry" hclass="entry" hlength="4" htag="section" id="sat_3" idm_id="000051619" sk="sat: :11" sum="54"><div class="top-container"><div class="top-g" id="sat_topg_3"><div class="webtop"><h1 class="headword" hclass="headword" htag="h1" id="sat_h_3">Sat.</h1> <span class="pos" hclass="pos" htag="span">abbreviation</span><span class="use" id="sat_use_1">in writing</span></div></div></div><ol class="sense_single" htag="ol"><li class="sense" hclass="sense" htag="li" id="sat_sng_4"><span class="sensetop" hclass="sensetop" htag="span"><span class="def" hclass="def" htag="span">Saturday</span></span></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_sat__gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_sat__gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_sat__us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_sat__us_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_s_a_t__1_gb_2_abbr" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_s_a_t__1_gb_2_abbr.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_s_a_t__1_us_1_abbr" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_s_a_t__1_us_1_abbr.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_sat__gb_2" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_sat__gb_2.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_sat__us_2" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_sat__us_2.mp3"></audio>`;
