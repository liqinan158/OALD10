In the US <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/savings-and-loan-association" title="savings and loan associations definition"><span class="ndv">savings and loan associations</span></a></span> provide a similar service. Mortgages are paid for from the interest paid by people borrowing money and from money placed by the public in savings accounts, which is then invested by the society at a profit.</span><span class="p">When they started building societies operated as <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/mutual" title="mutual definition"><span class="ndv">mutual</span></a> organizations</span> which shared profits with their members. The first building societies had a few members who paid <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/subscription" title="subscriptions definition"><span class="ndv">subscriptions</span></a> towards their own home. When homes had been built for all of them the societies were closed. In the 19th century hundreds of permanent societies were created throughout Britain. Names such as The Coventry Building Society showed their local origins. People investing money in these societies did so in order to obtain interest on their savings, not necessarily because they wanted a loan for a house. Many building societies later joined together to form larger, national organizations, each with hundreds of <span class="eb">branches</span>.</span><span class="p">In the 1980s and 1990s, building societies had to compete for customers with banks, which also offered mortgages, and they began to offer banking facilities themselves. After 1986, many of the larger building societies including the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/halifax" title="Halifax definition"><span class="ndv">Halifax</span></a> became banks. This meant that they could offer a full range of banking services. The country's largest surviving building society, the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/nationwide#nationwide_2" title="Nationwide definition"><span class="ndv">Nationwide</span></a>, decided not to become a bank because it believed that it could defend customers' interests more effectively as a building society.</span><span class="p">In the US savings and loan associations, also called <span class="eb">S &amp; Ls</span>, were created for people who wanted to get a mortgage or save money. Originally, they operated under different rules from banks and had limits on the services they could provide. In the 1980s, as in Britain, the rules changed and now S &amp; Ls and banks offer similar kinds of accounts.</span><span class="p">In the late 1980s S &amp; Ls got a bad reputation when many failed. This was partly because they had taken risks in investing money in an attempt to compete with banks, and partly because many were not run in an honest way. The US government gave back to people the money they had invested, but many Americans still associate S &amp; Ls with this problem. The S &amp; Ls that exist now are run under tighter controls and are regarded as safe places to keep money.</span><span class="p"><span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/credit-union" title="Credit Unions definition"><span class="ndv">Credit Unions</span></a></span> in the US are organizations that are owned by their members, and which do not aim to make a profit, which means that that they can offer financial services, such as loans, at a lower cost. They have become very popular. </span></span></span></div><span class="topic-g"><span class="prefix">Topics </span><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/topic/houses-and-homes?level=c2" title="Topic houses-and-homes"><span class="topic" href="l2:homes_and_buildings:houses_and_homes?cefr=c2"><span class="topic_name">Houses and homes</span><span class="topic_cefr">c2</span></span></a></span></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_savings_and_loan_association_1_gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_savings_and_loan_association_1_gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_savings_and_loan_association_1_gb_3" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_savings_and_loan_association_1_gb_3.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_savings_and_loan_association_1_us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_savings_and_loan_association_1_us_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_savings_and_loan_association_1_us_4" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_savings_and_loan_association_1_us_4.mp3"></audio>`;
