The main difference is that counties have two levels of local government, at county and at district level, and unitary authorities and council areas have only one level. Some towns that were previously part of counties, for example <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/southampton" title="Southampton definition"><span class="ndv">Southampton</span></a>, are now separate unitary authorities. Many people are confused by all the changes and continue to use the old county names.</span><span class="p">In the US most states are divided into counties, which are the largest units of local government.
