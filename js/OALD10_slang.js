They may be new, or existing words used in a new sense and context. As time goes by, some are used more widely and are no longer thought of as slang. <span class="ei">Clever</span> and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/naughty" title="naughty definition"><span class="ndv">naughty</span></a>, for instance, were both originally slang words that are now accepted as standard. Many slang words die out after a few years or sooner. The regular introduction of new words to replace them helps keep the language alive.</span><span class="p">A lot of slang words are used only by a particular social group. Use of slang suggests an easy, informal relationship between people and helps to make social identity stronger. In the 18th century the word <span class="ei">slang</span> described the language of criminals, but since then every group in society has developed its own slang terms. Young people also develop slang expressions to show that they are different from older people.</span><span class="p">The <span class="eb">street language</span> of young people changes fast. Street slang includes words relating to young people's attitudes. Young people today may describe something attractive or exciting as <span class="ei">bangin'</span>, <span class="ei">sick</span>, <span class="ei">lit</span> or <span class="ei">lush</span>. Something that is not very interesting or exciting is <span class="ei">meh</span>. A good-looking person is <span class="ei">buff</span> and a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/muscular" title="muscular definition"><span class="ndv">muscular</span></a> man is <span class="ei">hench</span>. Anything bad is <span class="ei">gross</span> or <span class="ei">minging</span>. If someone makes a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/fool#fool_1" title="fool definition"><span class="ndv">fool</span></a> of you, you've been <span class="ei">owned</span>. Having a good time with friends is referred to as <span class="ei">chilling</span> and music is often referred to as <span class="ei">tunes</span>. As people get older they sometimes keep on using the same slang words and in this way slang may indicate a person's age. The parents of today's young people used <span class="ei">cool</span>, <span class="ei">ace</span> and <span class="ei">wicked</span> to describe something good, and <span class="ei">lame</span>, <span class="ei">sad</span> or <span class="ei">naff</span> to describe someone or something they disliked, and many of them still use these words. When older people try to use current street slang, it often sounds odd.</span><span class="p">A lot of street slang refers to drink, drugs and sex. Many of these words and phrases are not <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/socially" title="socially definition"><span class="ndv">socially</span></a> acceptable and are widely considered rude and offensive. The expressions <span class="ei">pissed</span>, <span class="ei">hammered</span> and <span class="ei">shit-faced</span> relate to being drunk. There are many expressions for <span class="ndv" href="vomit_subentryg_1:vomit_topg_2" tofix="">vomiting</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= bringing food and drink back up through the mouth)</span>, for example, <span class="ei">vom</span>, <span class="ei">chunder</span> or <span class="ei">barf</span>. Slang words for drugs include <span class="ei">smack</span> (<a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/heroin" title="heroin definition"><span class="ndv">heroin</span></a>), <span class="ei">E</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/ecstasy" title="ecstasy definition"><span class="ndv">ecstasy</span></a>)</span> and <span class="ei">coke</span> (<a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/cocaine" title="cocaine definition"><span class="ndv">cocaine</span></a>). Expressions connected with drug-taking include <span class="ei">chasing the dragon</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= smoking heroin in <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/tinfoil" title="tinfoil definition"><span class="ndv">tinfoil</span></a>)</span>, <span class="ei">doing a line</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= <span class="ndv" href="sniff_subentryg_1:sniff_topg_2" tofix="">sniffing</span> <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/cocaine" title="cocaine definition"><span class="ndv">cocaine</span></a> through the nose)</span> and <span class="ei">jacking/​shooting up</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/inject" title="injecting definition"><span class="ndv">injecting</span></a> drugs)</span>. The film <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/trainspotting#trainspotting_2" title="Trainspotting definition"><span class="ndv">Trainspotting</span></a> helped to make some of these terms more widely known. <span class="ei">Shagging</span>, <span class="ei">screwing</span> and <span class="ei">banging</span> all refer to sex. Other common slang expressions refer to the body's waste functions, for example, <span class="ei">piss</span>, <span class="ei">go for a slash</span>, <span class="ei">have a shit</span> and <span class="ei">take a dump</span>. Some words, such as <span class="ei">fuck</span> and <span class="ei">shit</span>, are frequently used <span class="eb">swear words</span> but they are still likely to offend many people.</span><span class="p">Many slang words are used in text messaging and social media. Common abbreviations used in messaging include <span class="ei">AFAIK</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= as far as I know)</span>, <span class="ei">BTW</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= by the way)</span>, <span class="ei">IMO</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= in my opinion)</span>, <span class="ei">LOL</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= laughing out loud)</span>, <span class="ei">OMG</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= oh my God)</span> and <span class="ei">WTF</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= what the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/fuck#fuck_1" title="fuck definition"><span class="ndv">fuck</span></a>)</span>. Other words and experessions are made shorter in a different way, for example, <span class="ei">totes</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= totally)</span> and <span class="ei">I can't even</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= I can't even speak because I'm so shocked or surprised)</span>. Your <span class="ei">bae</span> is your boyfriend or girlfriend, or any very close friend. A <span class="ei">troll</span> is someone who writes negative comments on a social media website in order to make people react. </span><span class="p">Some professions and areas of work have their own terms, often called <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/jargon" title="jargon definition"><span class="ndv">jargon</span></a></span>, which are different from slang. Many people learn bits of the jargon of other groups through television programmes and films about hospitals, law courts, prisons, etc. Some of the jargon that was originally used only by people who work with computers is now considered standard English. Most people know, for instance, that a <span class="ei">hacker</span> is somebody who gets into other people's computer systems without permission.</span></span></span></div><div class="collapse" hclass="collapse" htag="div"><span class="unbox" id="slang_unbox_2" unbox="extra_examples"><span class="box_title" onclick="toggle_active(this)">Extra Examples</span><ul class="examples" hclass="examples" htag="ul"><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_slang__3"><span class="unx">‘Ruby Murray’ is rhyming slang for ‘curry’.</span></li><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_slang__4"><span class="unx">‘Woofy’ is slang for ‘good-looking’.</span></li><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_slang__5"><span class="unx">The gang members use street slang.</span></li><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_slang__6"><span class="unx">cockney rhyming slang</span></li><li class="" htag="li" id="OALD10_slang__7"><span class="unx">military slang</span></li></ul></span></div><span class="topic-g"><span class="prefix">Topics </span><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/topic/language?level=b2" title="Topic language"><span class="topic" href="l2:communication:language?cefr=b2"><span class="topic_name">Language</span><span class="topic_cefr">b2</span></span></a></span><div class="collapse" hclass="collapse" htag="div"><span class="unbox" id="slang_unbox_3" unbox="snippet"><span class="box_title" onclick="toggle_active(this)">Oxford Collocations Dictionary</span><span class="body"><span class="unbox">adjective</span><ul class="collocs_list"><li class="li">current</li><li class="li">modern</li><li class="li">common</li><li class="li">…</li></ul><span class="unbox">verb + slang</span><ul class="collocs_list"><li class="li">use</li></ul><span class="unbox">slang + noun</span><ul class="collocs_list"><li class="li">expression</li><li class="li">name</li><li class="li">term</li><li class="li">…</li></ul><span class="unbox">preposition</span><ul class="collocs_list"><li class="li">in slang</li><li class="li">slang for</li></ul><span class="xref_to_full_entry">See <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/collocations/slang" title=" definition in Collocations">full entry</a></span></span></span></div><div class="collapse" hclass="collapse" htag="div"><span class="unbox" id="slang_unbox_1" unbox="wordorigin"><span class="box_title" onclick="toggle_active(this)">Word Origin</span><span class="body"><span class="p">mid 18th cent.: of unknown origin.</span></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_slang__gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_slang__gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_slang__us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_slang__us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
