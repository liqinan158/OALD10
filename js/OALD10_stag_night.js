when people <span class="eb">get married</span>. <span class="eb">Marriage</span> is the state of being married, though the word can also mean the wedding ceremony. In England, Wales and Scotland, and in all 50 states of the US, it is legal for couples of the same sex to marry.</span><span class="p">Before getting married a couple usually <span class="eb">get engaged</span>. In a male-female relationship, it is traditional for the man to <span class="eb">propose</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= ask his girlfriend to marry him)</span> (sometimes called <span class="eb">popping the question</span>) and, if she accepts, give his new <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/fiancee" title="fiancée definition"><span class="ndv">fiancée</span></a></span> an <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/engagement-ring" title="engagement ring definition"><span class="ndv">engagement ring</span></a></span>, which she wears on the third finger of her left hand. Today many couples decide together to get married.</span><span class="p">The couple then <span class="eb">set a date</span> and decide who will perform the marriage ceremony and where it will be held. In the US judges and religious leaders can perform weddings. The ceremony can take place anywhere and couples often choose somewhere that is special to them. Religious weddings are often held in a church or <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/chapel" title="chapel definition"><span class="ndv">chapel</span></a>, although many churches do not conduct <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/same-sex" title="same-sex definition"><span class="ndv">same-sex</span></a> weddings. In Britain many couples choose to be married in church, even if they are not religious. Others will have a <span class="eb">civil ceremony</span> conducted by a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/registrar" title="registrar definition"><span class="ndv">registrar</span></a></span> at a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/registry-office" title="registry office definition"><span class="ndv">registry office</span></a></span> or at one of the many hotels and historic buildings which are <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/licensed" title="licensed definition"><span class="ndv">licensed</span></a> for weddings.</span><span class="p">In the past, it was traditional for the family of the <span class="eb">bride</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= the woman who is to be married)</span> to pay for the wedding, but today the couple usually pay all or part of the cost. Many people choose a traditional wedding with a hundred or more <span class="eb">guests</span>. Before the wedding, the couple send out printed <span class="eb">invitations</span> and guests either buy a gift for them, contribute to the couple's <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/honeymoon#honeymoon_1" title="honeymoon definition"><span class="ndv">honeymoon</span></a></span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= a holiday taken after the wedding)</span> or make a donation to a charity chosen by the couple. Couples often make a list of items that they would like at a large store. Guests can look at the list online and buy a present. In Britain couples sometimes send a <span class="eb">wedding list</span> to guests to help them to choose a suitable present.</span><span class="p">Before a wedding can take place in a church it must be announced there on three occasions. This is called <span class="eb">the reading of the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/banns" title="banns definition"><span class="ndv">banns</span></a></span>.

The couple together cut a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/wedding-cake" title="wedding cake definition"><span class="ndv">wedding cake</span></a></span>, which usually has several <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/tier" title="tiers definition"><span class="ndv">tiers</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= layers)</span>, and may be covered with white icing (<span class="ei">NAmE</span> <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/frosting" title="frosting definition"><span class="ndv">frosting</span></a>), perhaps with figures of the couple on the top one.
