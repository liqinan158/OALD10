However, British people tend not to judge <span class="eb">quality of life</span> by money alone, and would point out that factors such as a stable political situation, freedom of speech and choice, and relatively little official <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/interference" title="interference definition"><span class="ndv">interference</span></a> in their lives also affect their levels of satisfaction.</span><span class="p"><span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/disposable" title="Disposable definition"><span class="ndv">Disposable</span></a> income</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= the amount of money people have to spend after paying taxes)</span> is commonly used to measure the standard of living. People with low wages or who are unemployed, and people who have retired, have less income and a lower standard of living. Although disposable income has been rising in the country as a whole, the gap between rich and poor continues to grow wider. In 2016 the richest 10% of people owned about 40% of the total wealth. Standards of living also vary from region to region, the richest region being the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-south-east" title="South-East definition"><span class="ndv">South-East</span></a>. </span><span class="p">In the 1920s people in the US began to believe in the <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-american-dream" title="American dream definition"><span class="ndv">American dream</span></a></span>, the idea that anyone who worked hard could have material possessions as a reward. Having such possessions proves that a person is hard-working, so many people try to have everything their neighbours have, a practice called ‘keeping up with the Joneses’. As a result, America is often said to be a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/consumer" title="consumer definition"><span class="ndv">consumer</span></a> society</span>. The material standard of living is very high and the cost of living relatively low.
