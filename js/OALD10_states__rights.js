The principle of states' rights is supported by those who think that the central government should not be too involved in state affairs. It has been supported especially by the states in the South, five of which voted for the States' Rights Party in the 1948 election for President. There has been much argument in US history over the division of responsibility between state and national governments. In recent years the national government has given more rights to the states.</span></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_states_rights_1_gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_states_rights_1_gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_states_rights_1_us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_states_rights_1_us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
