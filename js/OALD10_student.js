This is often not true. Many older people study at college or university, sometimes on a part-time basis while having a job and looking after a family. Many students are highly <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/motivated" title="motivated definition"><span class="ndv">motivated</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= keen to do well)</span> and work very hard.</span><span class="p">In Britain reduced government support for higher education <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= education after A level)</span> means that students can no longer rely on having their expenses paid for them. In the past, students received a <span class="eb">grant</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= regular payments of money)</span> towards their living expenses. Now most can only get a <span class="eb">loan</span>, which has to be paid back. They also have to pay a fixed amount towards <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/tuition" title="tuition definition"><span class="ndv">tuition</span></a> fees</span> up to a maximum of just over £9 000 per year. Scottish students studying at Scottish universities do not pay fees. In the US students also have to pay for tuition. Many get <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/financial-aid" title="financial aid definition"><span class="ndv">financial aid</span></a> </span>which may include grants, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/scholarship" title="scholarships definition"><span class="ndv">scholarships</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= awards of money for study)</span> and loans. The fear of having large debts places a lot of pressure on students and many take part-time jobs during the term and work full-time in the vacations. Even so, a majority of students leave higher education having borrowed a lot of money.</span><span class="p">Many students in Britain go to a university away from their home town. They usually live in a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/hall-of-residence" title="hall of residence definition"><span class="ndv">hall of residence</span></a></span> for their first year, and then move into a rented room in a private house or share a house with <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/housemate" title="housemates definition"><span class="ndv">housemates</span></a></span>. They may go back home during vacations, but after they graduate most leave home for good. In the US many students now save money by living at home and attending college nearby. Others attend colleges some distance from where their parents live and they may live <span class="eb">on campus</span> in one of the halls, or <span class="eb">off campus</span> in apartments and houses which they share with <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/room-mate" title="roommates definition"><span class="ndv">roommates</span></a></span>. Some students, especially at larger universities, join a <span class="ndv" href="fraternity_d_1" tofix="" xt="andv">fraternity</span> or <span class="ndv" href="sorority_d_1" tofix="" xt="andv">sorority</span>, a social group usually with its own house near the campus. Fraternities and sororities often have names which are combinations of two or three Greek letters. Some people do not have a good opinion of them because they think that students who are members spend too much time having parties.</span><span class="p">In Britain the interests of students are represented by a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/students-union" title="students' union definition"><span class="ndv">students' union</span></a></span> which acts as a link with the university on academic matters, arranges social events and provides advice to students. Individual unions are <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/affiliated" title="affiliated definition"><span class="ndv">affiliated</span></a> with <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= linked to)</span> the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-nus#the_nus_topg_1" title="NUS definition"><span class="ndv">NUS</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= the National Union of Students)</span>. The student union building is usually the centre of student life and has a bar and common room, and often a restaurant and shops. British universities have a wide range of societies, clubs and social activities including sports, drama and politics. </span><span class="p">Especially in their first year, US students spend a lot of time on social activities. One of the most important celebrations, especially at universities which place a lot of emphasis on sports, is <span class="eb"><span class="ndv" href="homecoming_d_1" tofix="" xt="andv">homecoming</span></span>. Many <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/alumni" title="alumni definition"><span class="ndv">alumni</span></a></span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= former students)</span> return to their <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/alma-mater" title="alma mater definition"><span class="ndv">alma mater</span></a></span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= college)</span> for a weekend in the autumn to watch a football game. During homecoming weekend there are also parties and dances, and usually a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/parade#parade_1" title="parade definition"><span class="ndv">parade</span></a>.</span><span class="p">When social activities take up too much time, students <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/skip#skip_1" title="skip definition"><span class="ndv">skip</span></a> lectures</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= miss them)</span> or <span class="eb">cut class</span> (<span class="ei">NAmE</span>) and <span class="eb">take <span class="ndv" href="incomplete_subentryg_2:incomplete_topg_3" tofix="">incompletes</span></span> (<span class="ei">NAmE</span>), which means they have to finish their work after the vacation. In the US this has the effect of lowering their course grades, but most US universities expect this behaviour from students and do little to stop it. Students are thought to be old enough to make their own decisions about how hard they work and to accept the consequences. A few students <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/drop-out" title="drop out definition"><span class="ndv">drop out</span></a></span>
