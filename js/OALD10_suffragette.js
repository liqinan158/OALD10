But the word <span class="ei">suffrage</span> is more closely associated with women's voting rights, and the women who took part in the movement were often called <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/suffragette" title="suffragettes definition"><span class="ndv">suffragettes</span></a></span>. Today, most people in the US use the word <span class="eb">suffragists</span>, as it also includes the men who supported the movement.</span><span class="p">The suffrage movement became important in the US in the second half of the 19th century. As early as 1848 a meeting was held in Seneca Falls, New York, to discuss the issue. But only in 1920 was the US <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/constitution" title="Constitution definition"><span class="ndv">Constitution</span></a> changed to give women the right to vote. The <span class="eb">Nineteenth Amendment</span> to the Constitution is sometimes called the <span class="eb">Anthony Amendment</span>, after <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/susan-b-anthony" title="Susan B Anthony definition"><span class="ndv">Susan B Anthony</span></a>, who was an important suffragist.</span><span class="p">In the late 19th and early 20th century women in the UK also began to demand the right to vote. After several bills promising them suffrage were defeated in Parliament, British suffragettes turned to violent protest. As well as holding noisy public meetings they chained themselves to iron <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/railing" title="railings definition"><span class="ndv">railings</span></a> and broke windows of government buildings. One suffragette, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/emily-davison" title="Emily Davison definition"><span class="ndv">Emily Davison</span></a>, threw herself in front of the king's horse during a race at <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/epsom" title="Epsom definition"><span class="ndv">Epsom</span></a> and died from her injuries. When suffragettes were put in prison many of them went on <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/hunger-strike" title="hunger strike definition"><span class="ndv">hunger strike</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= refused to eat anything)</span>, so that the authorities had to force food into them to keep them alive. Leaders of the campaign, such as <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/emmeline-pankhurst" title="Emmeline Pankhurst definition"><span class="ndv">Emmeline Pankhurst</span></a>, the head of the Women's Social and Political Union, and her daughters Christabel and Sylvia, were put in prison on many occasions under the terms of the so-called <span class="eb">Cat and Mouse Act</span> of 1913, which allowed the women out of prison just long enough for them to get well before they were taken back to prison again. The campaign was interrupted in 1914 at the start of <span class="ndv" href="worldwari_d_1" tofix="" xt="andv">First World War</span>, so that women could contribute to the war effort. When the war ended in 1918 the government at last agreed to give the vote to women over 30, partly in <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/recognition" title="recognition definition"><span class="ndv">recognition</span></a> of their role in the war. Finally, in 1928, women won equal voting rights with men and were allowed to vote from the age of 21.</span></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_suffragette__gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_suffragette__gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_suffragette__us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_suffragette__us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
