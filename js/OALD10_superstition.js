The number 13 is considered <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/unlucky" title="unlucky definition"><span class="ndv">unlucky</span></a> because there were 13 people (Jesus and the twelve <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/apostle" title="Apostles definition"><span class="ndv">Apostles</span></a>) at the Last Supper. Tall buildings often do not have a 13th floor; instead the numbers go from 12 to 14.

Actors believe that wishing somebody good luck will bring them the opposite, and often say ‘<span class="eb">break a leg</span>’ instead. They also think it brings bad luck to call Shakespeare's play <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/macbeth" title="Macbeth definition"><span class="ndv">Macbeth</span></a> by its name and prefer to call it 'the Scottish play' instead.</span><span class="p">There are many other ways, apart from reading a horoscope, of finding out what will happen in the future. <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/fortune-teller" title="Fortune tellers definition"><span class="ndv">Fortune tellers</span></a></span> at fairs use a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/crystal-ball" title="crystal ball definition"><span class="ndv">crystal ball</span></a></span> or <span class="eb">read a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/palm#palm_1" title="palm definition"><span class="ndv">palm</span></a></span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= look at the lines on a person's hand)</span> to <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/foretell" title="foretell definition"><span class="ndv">foretell</span></a></span> the future.
