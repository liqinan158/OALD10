Most of their songs were written by Lennon and McCartney. After their first great success with <span class="ebi">Please Please Me</span> in 1963, their records were regularly No 1 hits in Britain and the US. In the late 1960s they became interested in eastern religions and drugs, and these influences appeared in their music. They separated in 1970 to follow individual careers. They have had more influence on the development of pop music than any other group. They also made several successful films.</span></span></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_the_beatles_1_gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_the_beatles_1_gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_the_beatles_1_us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_the_beatles_1_us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
