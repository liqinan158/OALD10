New judges are chosen each year and include famous critics, writers and academics. The prize was first given by Booker, a large food company, in 1969. Between 2002 and 2019 the Man Group provided the money for the prize and it was known as the Man Booker Prize. From 2005 to 2015 The Man Booker International Prize was awarded to a writer from any country in the world whose books are available in English and who is considered to have made an important contribution to literature. Since 2016 the International Prize has been awarded every year for a single book that has been translated into English.</span></span></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_booker_prize_1_gb_2" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_booker_prize_1_gb_2.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_booker_prize_1_us_2" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_booker_prize_1_us_2.mp3"></audio>`;
