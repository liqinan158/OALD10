After 50 years it had more than 46 000 miles/75 000 kilometres of road. The interstate system helped the country's economy a lot, but it also hurt the economies of many small towns not on an interstate. Interstates running north to south have odd numbers and those going from east to west have even numbers. They often have only two or three <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/lane#lane_sng_3" title="lanes definition"><span class="ndv">lanes</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= marked sections for lines of traffic)</span> in each direction through the countryside but may have many more each way through cities. </span><span class="p">Other major roads in the US are called <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/superhighway" title="superhighways definition"><span class="ndv">superhighways</span></a></span>, <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/freeway" title="freeways definition"><span class="ndv">freeways</span></a></span>, <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/expressway" title="expressways definition"><span class="ndv">expressways</span></a></span>, <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/thruway" title="thruways definition"><span class="ndv">thruways</span></a></span> or <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/parkway" title="parkways definition"><span class="ndv">parkways</span></a></span>.

Since 1995 states have been able to set their own speed limits. This is usually between 65 amd 80 mph/105 and 128 kph on interstate roads but lower on other main roads.</span><span class="p">In Britain the fastest and most direct routes between major cities are by <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/motorway" title="motorways definition"><span class="ndv">motorways</span></a></span>, which usually have three lanes of traffic in each direction and a speed limit of 70 mph/112 kph. Each motorway is identified by the letter ‘M’ and a number. Main roads other than motorways are called <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/a-road" title="A-roads definition"><span class="ndv">A-roads</span></a></span> and are numbered A6, A34, etc. Some A-roads are <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/dual-carriageway" title="dual carriageways definition"><span class="ndv">dual carriageways</span></a></span> with two or more lanes each way.

Narrower roads which have only one lane in each direction are called <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/b-road" title="B-roads definition"><span class="ndv">B-roads</span></a></span>.

Only a very few roads have tolls but Britain's first toll motorway, the M6 Toll, opened in 2003 as an alternative to the heavily used M6 near <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/birmingham#birmingham_ng_1" title="Birmingham definition"><span class="ndv">Birmingham</span></a>. Narrow country roads below B-road standard (called <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/unclassified#unclassified_sng_3" title="unclassified definition"><span class="ndv">unclassified</span></a> roads</span>) may be known by the name of the place they go to, for example Orston Lane. Some country roads may be <span class="eb">single track</span> and only wide enough for one vehicle. In this case, there are <span class="eb">passing places</span>, where a vehicle can wait to let another through.</span><span class="p">In Britain the <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-highway-code" title="Highway Code definition"><span class="ndv">Highway Code</span></a></span> describes the many signs placed next to roads. Round red signs give instructions that must by law be obeyed. These include ‘no entry’ signs and signs about speed limits. Red triangle-shaped signs give warnings about possible dangers ahead, for example children crossing the road. Direction signs to major towns are blue on motorways and green on other roads; signs to smaller places are white. Old-fashioned <span class="eb"><span class="ndv" href="signpost_subentryg_1:signpost_topg_2" tofix="">signposts</span></span> can still be seen in some country areas.</span><span class="p">In the US red road signs, like ‘Stop’, must be obeyed. Signs that indicate danger, as in areas where rocks might fall, have a yellow diamond shape. Many other US road signs are now similar to those in Europe.</span><span class="p">In Britain there is pressure from both business and private road users for more and better roads, despite the damage to the environment and increase in pollution that this may cause. People who are against the building of new roads regularly challenge proposed routes of new motorways or bypasses. If they fail, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/environmentalist" title="environmentalists definition"><span class="ndv">environmentalists</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= people who care a lot about the environment)</span> may set up protest camps along the route of the new road. Recently, experts too have questioned whether it is a good idea to build more roads, saying it simply encourages greater use of cars. In the US there are few protests against road-building. People generally want more roads to make their journeys faster and more convenient.</span></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_highway_code_1_gb_2" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_highway_code_1_gb_2.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_highway_code_1_us_2" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_highway_code_1_us_2.mp3"></audio>`;
