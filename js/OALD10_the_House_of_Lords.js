The most senior rank is that of <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/duke#duke_1" title="duke definition"><span class="ndv">duke</span></a></span> (for a man) or <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/duchess" title="duchess definition"><span class="ndv">duchess</span></a></span> (for a woman), a hereditary title which was created in <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/norman#norman_sng_2" title="Norman definition"><span class="ndv">Norman</span></a> times. There are five royal <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/duke#duke_1" title="Dukes definition"><span class="ndv">Dukes</span></a>, including the <span class="eb">Duke of Edinburgh</span>, and 24 other Dukes. The second most senior rank is that of <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/marquess" title="marquess definition"><span class="ndv">marquess</span></a></span> (man) or <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/marchioness" title="marchioness definition"><span class="ndv">marchioness</span></a></span> (woman), of which there are under 40.

This is the oldest title of all. Next in rank is a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/viscount" title="viscount definition"><span class="ndv">viscount</span></a></span> (man) or <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/viscountess" title="viscountess definition"><span class="ndv">viscountess</span></a></span> (woman). The fifth and lowest rank of the peerage is that of <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/baron" title="baron definition"><span class="ndv">baron</span></a></span> (man) or <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/baroness" title="baroness definition"><span class="ndv">baroness</span></a></span> (woman), of which there are around 500 with hereditary titles. At present, about two thirds of all peers hold hereditary titles, many of which were originally given by the king or queen of the time to close friends or in return for some service. Senior titles often include the name of the place where the family comes from, for example, the Duke of Devonshire, the Marquess of Normanby. A woman may be a duchess, marchioness, etc. in her own right or receive the title when she marries a duke, etc.</span><span class="p">Life peers include the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-lords-spiritual" title="Lords Spiritual definition"><span class="ndv">Lords Spiritual</span></a>, who are the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/archbishop" title="archbishop of Canterbury definition"><span class="ndv">archbishop of Canterbury</span></a> and the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-archbishop-of-york" title="Archbishop of York definition"><span class="ndv">Archbishop of York</span></a> and 24 <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/bishop" title="bishops definition"><span class="ndv">bishops</span></a> of the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-church-of-england" title="Church of England definition"><span class="ndv">Church of England</span></a> and, since 1958, many other men and women who have been <span class="eb">given a peerage</span> because of their public service. Most of these are given the rank of baron or baroness. Until 2009 the most senior judges in the country were the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-law-lords" title="Law Lords definition"><span class="ndv">Law Lords</span></a>, who also sat in the House of Lords, but the most senior judges are now called <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/justice#justice_sng_4" title="Justices definition"><span class="ndv">Justices</span></a> of the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-supreme-court" title="Supreme Court definition"><span class="ndv">Supreme Court</span></a></span> and are no longer members of the House of Lords.</span><span class="p">There are complicated rules for how to address and refer to members of the peerage. Dukes, for instance, are addressed as 'Your Grace', marquesses and earls as 'My Lord', and viscounts and barons as 'Lord X'. There are also rules for addressing members of their families. Most British people know that such complicated forms of address exist but many would not be able to use them correctly, and would probably think that they are rather strange and old-fashioned.</span><span class="p">Peers cannot be elected to the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-house-of-commons" title="House of Commons definition"><span class="ndv">House of Commons</span></a> as <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/member-of-parliament" title="Members of Parliament definition"><span class="ndv">Members of Parliament</span></a> unless they have first <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/disclaim" title="disclaimed definition"><span class="ndv">disclaimed</span></a></span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= given up)</span> their title. <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/tony-benn" title="Tony Benn definition"><span class="ndv">Tony Benn</span></a> fought a campaign for members of the peerage to have this right and was himself the first to be able to give up his title and become an <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/mp" title="MP definition"><span class="ndv">MP</span></a>. Former members of the House of Commons who have been <span class="eb">elevated to the peerage</span> as a reward for their service are sometimes said to have been 'kicked upstairs'.</span><span class="p">At present, all life peers and some hereditary peers may take part in the government of Britain by <span class="eb">taking their seat</span> in the House of Lords , though many do not attend regularly. When a Labour government was elected in 1997, it stated that it would get rid of the hereditary peerage and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/reform#reform_1" title="reform definition"><span class="ndv">reform</span></a> the Upper House. Since then there have been many changes and the number of hereditary peers in the House of Lords has been reduced a lot and many more life peers created, but no agreement has been reached about the reform of the Upper House. There have been campaigns both for members to be elected and for the appointment of members by a commission.</span></span></span></div> </li><li cefr="c2" class="sense" hclass="sense" htag="li" id="houseoflords_sng_2" sensenum="2"><span class="sensetop" hclass="sensetop" htag="span"><span class="grammar" hclass="grammar" htag="span">[singular]</span></span> <span class="def" hclass="def" htag="span">the building where members of <span class="dh">the House of Lords</span> meet</span><span class="topic-g"><span class="prefix">Topics </span><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/topic/politics?level=c2" title="Topic politics"><span class="topic" href="l2:politics_and_society:politics?cefr=c2"><span class="topic_name">Politics</span><span class="topic_cefr">c2</span></span></a></span> </li> <span class="xrefs" hclass="xrefs" htag="span" id="the_house_of_lords_xrgs_19" xt="cp"><span class="prefix">compare</span> <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-house-of-commons" title="House of Commons definition"><span bord="n" class="xr-g" href="houseofcommons_e" id="the_house_of_lords_xrg_20"><span class="xh">House of Commons</span></span></a></span></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_house_of_lords_the_1_gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_house_of_lords_the_1_gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_house_of_lords_the_1_us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_house_of_lords_the_1_us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
