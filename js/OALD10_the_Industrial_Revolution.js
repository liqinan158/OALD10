During this time, many important machines were invented. These were mostly made possible by the discovery of <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/steam#steam_1" title="steam definition"><span class="ndv">steam</span></a> power from coal and the invention of the steam engine, which allowed one person to do what before had required many workers. As a result, big factories were built which could produce a wide variety of goods in large quantities. New methods of transport, in particular <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/canal" title="canals definition"><span class="ndv">canals</span></a> and railways, were developed for transporting coal and goods from place to place. During the Industrial Revolution, the populations of cities grew rapidly as people moved from the countryside to work in factories and Britain became known as the ‘ <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/workshop" title="workshop definition"><span class="ndv">workshop</span></a> of the world’.
