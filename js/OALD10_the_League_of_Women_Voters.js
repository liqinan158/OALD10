It now encourages citizens to take part in politics and to vote, and tries to influence the government on important issues. It does not support any particular political parties or candidates but organizes debates between the candidates for various levels of government, and provides information about candidates through its website. It was originally called the National American Woman Suffrage Association and changed its name in 1920, the year in which American women won the right to vote. Men have been admitted as members since 1974.</span></span></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_league_of_women_voters_1_gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_league_of_women_voters_1_gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_league_of_women_voters_1_us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_league_of_women_voters_1_us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
