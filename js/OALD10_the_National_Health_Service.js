The National Health Service was introduced in 1946 by the Labour government as part of the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/welfare-state" title="welfare state definition"><span class="ndv">welfare state</span></a> system recommended in the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-beveridge-report" title="Beveridge Report definition"><span class="ndv">Beveridge Report</span></a>, and it came into operation in 1948. At first it provided free medical, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/dental" title="dental definition"><span class="ndv">dental</span></a> and hospital services for everyone, but in the 1950s charges for medicines and dental services were introduced for most people. Since then the cost of the NHS has continued to rise and governments have been forced to find new ways of paying for it. Conservative governments are often accused of trying to <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/privatize" title="privatize definition"><span class="ndv">privatize</span></a> the NHS <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= sell it to private owners)</span>, for example, by introducing <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/hospital-trust#hospital_trust_topg_1" title="hospital trusts definition"><span class="ndv">hospital trusts</span></a> and encouraging the growth of private medical services and private medical insurance. There are now fewer NHS dentists, but treatment by doctors and hospitals is still free of charge to patients and charges for medicines only apply in England.<span class="xrefs" hclass="xrefs" htag="span" xt="see"><span class="prefix">see also</span> <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/private-patient" title="private patient definition"><span bord="n" class="xr-g" href="privatepatient_e"><span class="xh">private patient</span></span></a></span></span></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_national_health_service_1_gb_2" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_national_health_service_1_gb_2.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_national_health_service_1_us_2" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_national_health_service_1_us_2.mp3"></audio>`;
