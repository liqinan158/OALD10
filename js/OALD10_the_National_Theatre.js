The National Theatre company was started in 1963. Its home was the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-old-vic#the_old_vic_topg_1" title="Old Vic definition"><span class="ndv">Old Vic</span></a> until the new National Theatre building was opened in 1976. In 1988 the title <span class="ei">Royal</span> was officially added to the company's name to mark its 25th anniversary. However, most people call the company and the building by their original name. The three theatres at the National are the Lyttelton, the Olivier (named after the company's first artistic director, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/laurence-olivier" title="Laurence Olivier definition"><span class="ndv">Laurence Olivier</span></a>) and the Dorfman (which used to be called the Cottesloe). The theatre presents a wide range of old and new plays and is known for the high quality of its productions. Since 2009 the theatre has regularly broadcast live performances via satellite to cinemas in the UK and around the world.</span></span></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_the_national_theatre_1_gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_the_national_theatre_1_gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_the_national_theatre_1_us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_the_national_theatre_1_us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
