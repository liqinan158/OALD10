From 1921 Northern Ireland was governed by a parliament in <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/stormont" title="Stormont definition"><span class="ndv">Stormont</span></a>, in <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/belfast" title="Belfast definition"><span class="ndv">Belfast</span></a>, but after the start of the political violence, known as the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-troubles" title="Troubles definition"><span class="ndv">Troubles</span></a>, the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/province" title="province definition"><span class="ndv">province</span></a> was placed under <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/direct-rule" title="direct rule definition"><span class="ndv">direct rule</span></a> from London. The Assembly has been in operation several times from 1973-75 and again from 1982-86. In 1986 the majority party, the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-ulster-unionist-party" title="Ulster Unionist Party definition"><span class="ndv">Ulster Unionist Party</span></a>, stopped supporting it because of the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-anglo-irish-agreement" title="Anglo-Irish Agreement definition"><span class="ndv">Anglo-Irish Agreement</span></a>. In 1998 the assembly was set up again as a separate parliament for Northern Ireland with 108 members (reduced to 90 from 2017) as part of the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-good-friday-agreement" title="Good Friday Agreement definition"><span class="ndv">Good Friday Agreement</span></a>.

The assembly was suspended again in 2002 because of arguments between political parties about sharing power. Elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly took place in March 2007 and it started again in May 2007. It was suspended again in January 2017 and restored in January 2020.</span></span></span></div></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_northern_ireland_assembly_1_gb_2" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_northern_ireland_assembly_1_gb_2.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_northern_ireland_assembly_1_us_2" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_northern_ireland_assembly_1_us_2.mp3"></audio>`;
