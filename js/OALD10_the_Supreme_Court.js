The <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-supreme-court" title="Supreme Court definition"><span class="ndv">Supreme Court</span></a></span> in <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/washington-dc" title="Washington, DC definition"><span class="ndv">Washington, DC</span></a> is the highest court in the US, and is very powerful. It has nine judges, called <span class="eb">justices</span> and in 1981 Sandra Day O'Connor became the first woman justice. The head of the court has the title of <span class="eb">Chief Justice of the United States</span>. Justices are chosen by the President, although the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/senate" title="Senate definition"><span class="ndv">Senate</span></a> must give its approval to the choice.</span><span class="p">Some of the power of the Supreme Court was given to it in the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/constitution" title="Constitution definition"><span class="ndv">Constitution</span></a>. In 1803, in a famous case called <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/marbury-v-madison" title="Marbury v Madison definition"><span class="ndv">Marbury v Madison</span></a>, the Court gave itself the additional power of <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/judicial-review" title="judicial review definition"><span class="ndv">judicial review</span></a></span>. This means that it has the power to decide if a law follows the principles of the Constitution. If a law is said to be <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/unconstitutional" title="unconstitutional definition"><span class="ndv">unconstitutional</span></a></span>, it cannot be put into effect unless it is added to the Constitution, a long and difficult process. In this way the Supreme Court has the power to stop laws made by the US government and state as well as local laws.</span><span class="p">The Supreme Court is a court of appeal and hears cases on appeal that were first heard in the lower courts. It can hear only a small number of appeals and so tries to choose cases that involve important principles of law. Once the Court has decided a case, lower courts use it as a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/precedent" title="precedent definition"><span class="ndv">precedent</span></a></span> and they then follow the Supreme Court's decision in similar cases.</span><span class="p">Many of the Supreme Court's decisions are famous because they changed some aspect of US life. For instance, in the cases <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/scott-v-sandford" title="Scott v Sandford definition"><span class="ndv">Scott v Sandford</span></a> (1857) , <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/plessy-v-ferguson" title="Plessy v Ferguson definition"><span class="ndv">Plessy v Ferguson</span></a> (1896) and <span class="ndv" href="brownvboardofeducation_d_1" tofix="" xt="andv">Brown v Board of Education</span> (1954) the Court made important decisions about the rights of African Americans. In <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/miranda#miranda_1" title="Miranda v Arizona definition"><span class="ndv">Miranda v Arizona</span></a> (1966) the Court said that police officers must inform the people they arrest of their rights under the constitution. The <span class="ndv" href="roevwade_d_1" tofix="" xt="andv">Roe v Wade</span> decision of 1973 gave women across the US the right to <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/abortion" title="abortion definition"><span class="ndv">abortion</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= an operation to prevent a baby from being born alive)</span>.
