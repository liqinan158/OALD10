The US became involved in Vietnam only gradually. At first, under President <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/dwight-d-eisenhower" title="Dwight D Eisenhower definition"><span class="ndv">Dwight D Eisenhower</span></a>, it provided the French with supplies. In 1954 the <span class="eb">Geneva Accords</span> divided Vietnam into the Communist North and the anti-Communist South. Under President <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/kennedy" title="John F Kennedy definition"><span class="ndv">John F Kennedy</span></a>, in the early 1960s, many US soldiers were sent to the South as <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/adviser" title="advisers definition"><span class="ndv">advisers</span></a>. In 1964, after an attack on US ships, <span class="ndv" href="congress_d_1" tofix="" xt="andv">Congress</span> passed the <span class="eb">Gulf of Tonkin Resolution</span> which gave President <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/lyndon-b-johnson" title="Lyndon B Johnson definition"><span class="ndv">Lyndon B Johnson</span></a> greater powers to fight a war, and in the spring of 1965 <span class="eb"><span class="ndv" href="marine_subentryg_2:marine_topg_3" tofix="">Marines</span></span> were sent to South Vietnam.</span><span class="p">It was easy to keep the <span class="ndv" href="communist_subentryg_1:communist_topg_1" tofix="">Communist</span> forces, called the <span class="eb">National Liberation Front</span> or the <span class="eb">Viet Cong</span>, out of South Vietnam, but much harder to defeat them. The US used bombs against the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/vietnamese" title="Vietnamese definition"><span class="ndv">Vietnamese</span></a> soldiers, and chemicals to destroy crops, which had a terrible effect on people as well as on the land. There were also reports of <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/atrocity" title="atrocities definition"><span class="ndv">atrocities</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= extremely violent and cruel acts)</span> committed by both sides. In 1968 the <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-my-lai-massacre" title="My Lai massacre definition"><span class="ndv">My Lai massacre</span></a></span>, in which over 300 ordinary people, including women and children, were killed by US soldiers, shocked Americans at home. Many US soldiers were not sure why they were fighting the war and became <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/traumatize" title="traumatized definition"><span class="ndv">traumatized</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= very upset and shocked)</span> by the violence around them. Discipline became a problem, and the use of drugs was common. </span><span class="p">In 1968 the Viet Cong started a major attack known as the <span class="eb">Tet Offensive</span>, and the US position in South Vietnam was threatened. As the war became more intense it lost support at home and also in other countries. When <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/richard-nixon" title="Richard Nixon definition"><span class="ndv">Richard Nixon</span></a> became President he at first tried to attack hard and force the Viet Cong to come to an agreement. The war then spread to Vietnam's neighbour, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/cambodia" title="Cambodia definition"><span class="ndv">Cambodia</span></a>. Finally, in 1972, Nixon sent Henry Kissinger to <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/negotiate" title="negotiate definition"><span class="ndv">negotiate</span></a> a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/ceasefire" title="ceasefire definition"><span class="ndv">ceasefire</span></a></span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= an agreement to end fighting)</span>, and afterwards the US was no longer directly involved in the war, though it continued to provide supplies. In 1975 the government of South Vietnam fell and the country was taken over by the Communist forces.</span><span class="p">The Vietnam War divided US society. Opposition to it was led mainly by university students, many of whom were young men facing <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/draft#draft_sng_3" title="the draft definition"><span class="ndv">the draft</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= service in the armed forces)</span>. They said they should not be forced to fight a war that they believed was wrong. As a protest, many burned their <span class="eb">draft cards</span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= documents showing that they could be called for military service)</span>. Some became <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/draft-dodger" title="draft dodgers definition"><span class="ndv">draft dodgers</span></a></span> by remaining students as long as possible, or by going to Canada. Others took their case to court on the grounds that they were <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/conscientious-objector" title="conscientious objectors definition"><span class="ndv">conscientious objectors</span></a></span> and had moral or religious reasons for not fighting a war. These protests resulted in violent conflicts between police and students. In the summer of 1968, during a protest in <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/chicago" title="Chicago definition"><span class="ndv">Chicago</span></a>, people saw on television the violent way in which the police behaved. In 1970, during another protest, the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-national-guard" title="National Guard definition"><span class="ndv">National Guard</span></a> shot and killed four American students at <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/kent-state-university" title="Kent State University definition"><span class="ndv">Kent State University</span></a> in <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/ohio" title="Ohio definition"><span class="ndv">Ohio</span></a>. After this, many of the <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-silent-majority#the_silent_majority_topg_1" title="silent majority definition"><span class="ndv">silent majority</span></a></span>, people whom Nixon thought supported the government, believed that things had gone too far and began to question government policy and the reasons why the US was involved in the war. But others continued to accuse the students of being <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/unpatriotic" title="unpatriotic definition"><span class="ndv">unpatriotic</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= not supporting their country)</span>.</span><span class="p">When Vietnam <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/veteran" title="veterans definition"><span class="ndv">veterans</span></a></span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= people who had fought in the war)</span> returned home they found that, instead of receiving the respect normally given to war veterans, they were the object of public anger. They had to deal with this in addition to the mental stress caused by the violence they had seen and taken part in. In the years since the war, films such as <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-deer-hunter" title="The Deer Hunter definition"><span class="ndv">The Deer Hunter</span></a> (1978) , <span class="ebi">Good Morning, Vietnam</span> (1987) and <span class="ebi">Born on the Fourth of July</span> (1989) have shown the war from different angles.</span><span class="p">The war in Vietnam taught the US that there are limits to its military strength, and showed that the American people were not willing to pay the high cost in money and in lives for a war away from home. The strong desire to avoid another Vietnam played an important role in deciding US foreign policy in the years that followed.</span></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html>`;
