The Prime Minister is Minister for the Civil Service.</span><span class="p">Some civil servants work in government departments . They are expected to work with a government formed by any <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/political" title="political definition"><span class="ndv">political</span></a> <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/party#party_sng_1" title="party definition"><span class="ndv">party</span></a> and to remain fair and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/impartial" title="impartial definition"><span class="ndv">impartial</span></a> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= favouring no party)</span>, whatever their personal opinions. A change of government, or the appointment of a new minister in charge of a department, does not involve a change of its civil servants. This is very useful to ministers who are new to an area of responsibility and have little time to learn about it. The most senior civil servant in a department is called the <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/permanent-undersecretary" title="Permanent Secretary definition"><span class="ndv">Permanent Secretary</span></a></span>.</span><span class="p">Ministers are not allowed to ask civil servants to do work that is intended to promote a political party. In the past ministers relied almost entirely on the advice of their civil servants when making decisions and the power that senior civil servants had over politicians has been shown in a humorous way in the television series <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/yes-minister" title="Yes, Minister definition"><span class="ndv">Yes, Minister</span></a>. Now, party politics and pressure from Members of Parliament and commercial organizations may have greater influence on decision-making.</span><span class="p">Most civil servants are not directly involved in government. They have technical or <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/administrative" title="administrative definition"><span class="ndv">administrative</span></a> jobs outside London, for example, calculating and collecting taxes or paying <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/social-security" title="social security definition"><span class="ndv">social security</span></a> benefits. The Civil Service <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/commissioner" title="Commissioners definition"><span class="ndv">Commissioners</span></a> are responsible for employing new staff and for ensuring that the way that staff members are chosen is fair.</span><span class="p">In the US civil servants are government employees who are chosen on the basis of ability and experience, not political favour. The US federal civil service was created so that government employees would not lose their jobs every time a new president was elected. Although the President can choose people for important jobs, the majority of the three million government employees are civil servants. Some people wanting a government job take the <span class="eb">Civil Service Exam</span>. Civil servants are expected to work for the benefit of the government, and not for any political party. Each individual state also has its own civil service which works in a similar way.</span></span></span></div><span class="topic-g"><span class="prefix">Topics </span><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/topic/politics?level=c2" title="Topic politics"><span class="topic" href="l2:politics_and_society:politics?cefr=c2"><span class="topic_name">Politics</span><span class="topic_cefr">c2</span></span></a></span><div class="collapse" hclass="collapse" htag="div"><span class="unbox" id="thecivilservice_unbox_1" unbox="wordorigin"><span class="box_title" onclick="toggle_active(this)">Word Origin</span><span class="body"><span class="p">late 18th cent.: originally applied to the part of the work of the British East India Company performed by staff who did not belong to the army or navy.</span></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_civil_service_the_1_gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_civil_service_the_1_gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_civil_service_the_1_us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_civil_service_the_1_us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
