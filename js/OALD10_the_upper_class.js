In <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/medieval" title="medieval definition"><span class="ndv">medieval</span></a> times soldiers were made knights in as a reward for doing military service for their local lord.

New knights receive their title at a special ceremony, during which they <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/kneel" title="kneel definition"><span class="ndv">kneel</span></a> in front of the king or queen, who touches them once on each shoulder with a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/sword" title="sword definition"><span class="ndv">sword</span></a>.

Other knights are known as <span class="eb">knights bachelor</span>.</span><span class="p">People who have an upper-class family background may be considered as part of the local aristocracy even if they do not have a title. They often have an upper-class <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/accent#accent_1" title="accent definition"><span class="ndv">accent</span></a> and conservative social and political views and are referred to as <span class="eb">the county set</span>. Members of the aristocracy are sometimes described as ' <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/blue-blooded" title="blue-blooded definition"><span class="ndv">blue-blooded</span></a>', because in former times their <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/vein" title="veins definition"><span class="ndv">veins</span></a> showed blue through their skin which was pale from not having to work in the fields.

In the past, members of the aristocracy could command respect because of their <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/noble#noble_1" title="noble definition"><span class="ndv">noble</span></a> birth. Now, people are much more critical of those who <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/inherit" title="inherit definition"><span class="ndv">inherit</span></a> honours but who from their behaviour do not appear to deserve them.</span><span class="p">The US has no formal aristocracy in that there are no families who have been given titles by the head of state. In fact, the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/constitution" title="Constitution definition"><span class="ndv">Constitution</span></a> does not allow an aristocracy, saying 'No title of <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/nobility" title="nobility definition"><span class="ndv">nobility</span></a> shall be granted by the United States.' Perhaps because of this, Americans are very interested in Britain's royal family and nobility. There is, however, respect for US families who, though they do not have titles, have wealth and a social position similar to the British aristocracy. Class in the US is, to a large extent, based on money, but some people have more respect for <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/old-money" title="old money definition"><span class="ndv">old money</span></a></span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= money, land, etc. that has belonged to a family for many years)</span> than <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/new-money" title="new money definition"><span class="ndv">new money</span></a></span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= money that a person has earned by working)</span>.
