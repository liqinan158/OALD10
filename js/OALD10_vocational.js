Colleges of further education run courses to provide a <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/theoretical" title="theoretical definition"><span class="ndv">theoretical</span></a> background.

Much vocational training is done by private institutions which are sometimes called <span class="eb">proprietary schools</span>. Although many of these are good, in general they have a bad reputation. This is partly because there are no controls over who can operate such a school. Some proprietary schools try to take money from as many students as possible, including some who will probably not be able to complete their training.</span><span class="p">Most US secondary schools programmes do not provide a choice between an academic and a practical programme of study, but most do give students an opportunity to take some practical or vocational classes.
