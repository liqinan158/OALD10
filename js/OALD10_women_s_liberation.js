The <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-equal-pay-act#the_equal_pay_act_topg_1" title="Equal Pay Act definition"><span class="ndv">Equal Pay Act</span></a> of 1970, for instance, made it illegal for women to be paid less than men for doing the same work, and in 1975 the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-sex-discrimination-act#the_sex_discrimination_act_topg_1" title="Sex Discrimination Act definition"><span class="ndv">Sex Discrimination Act</span></a> aimed to prevent either sex having an unfair advantage when applying for jobs. These two acts were replaced by the Equality Act in 2010. In 1975 the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-equal-opportunities-commission#the_equal_opportunities_commission_topg_1" title="Equal Opportunities Commission definition"><span class="ndv">Equal Opportunities Commission</span></a> was set up to help people claim their rights to equal treatment and to publish research and statistics to show where improvements in opportunities for women need to be made. Women now have much better employment opportunities than they did in the past, though they still tend to get less well-paid jobs than men (a situation known as the <span class="eb">gender pay gap</span>), and very few are given top jobs in industry.</span><span class="p">Many people believe that there is still a long way to go before women are treated as equals in employment. In education, however, girls' and women's opportunities have improved rapidly and in public employment there are policies to increase the percentage of women employed in senior management roles and in areas such as engineering and science.</span><span class="p">In the US the movement that is often called the ‘first wave of feminism’ began in the middle of the 1800s. <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/susan-b-anthony" title="Susan B Anthony definition"><span class="ndv">Susan B Anthony</span></a> worked for the right to vote, Margaret Sanger wanted to provide women with the means of <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/contraception" title="contraception definition"><span class="ndv">contraception</span></a> so that they could decide whether or not to have children, and Elizabeth Blackwell, who had to fight for the chance to become a doctor, wanted women to have greater opportunities to study. Many <span class="eb"><span class="ndv" href="feminist_subentryg_2:feminist_topg_2" tofix="">feminists</span></span> were interested in other social issues.</span><span class="p">The second wave of feminism began in the 1960s. Women like <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/betty-friedan" title="Betty Friedan definition"><span class="ndv">Betty Friedan</span></a> and Gloria Steinem became associated with the fight to get equal rights and opportunities for women under the law. An important issue was the <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-equal-rights-amendment" title="Equal Rights Amendment definition"><span class="ndv">Equal Rights Amendment</span></a></span> (<span class="eb">ERA</span>), which was intended to change the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/constitution" title="Constitution definition"><span class="ndv">Constitution</span></a>. Although the ERA was not passed there was progress in other areas. It became illegal for employers, schools, clubs, etc. to <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/discriminate" title="discriminate definition"><span class="ndv">discriminate</span></a> against women. But women still find it hard to advance beyond a certain point in their careers, the so-called <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/glass-ceiling" title="glass ceiling definition"><span class="ndv">glass ceiling</span></a></span> that prevents them from having high-level jobs. Although there is greater equality in some homes, women also still face the problem of the <span class="eb">second shift</span>, which is the work they do at home, running a household and caring for children. However, both British and American women have more opportunities than anyone thought possible in previous generations.</span><span class="p">In the 1980s feminism became less popular in the US and there was less interest in solving the remaining problems, such as the fact that many women still earn less than men. In the late 2010s feminism experienced a new rise in popularity when women spoke out about the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/abuse#abuse_1" title="abuse definition"><span class="ndv">abuse</span></a> of power, especially by men in the film industry. Social media was an important factor: the <span class="eb">#MeToo</span> <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/hashtag" title="hashtag definition"><span class="ndv">hashtag</span></a> was used to draw attention to women's experiences of poor treatment and abuse at work, and in their lives in general. One of the biggest changes is in how people think. Although there is still <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/discrimination" title="discrimination definition"><span class="ndv">discrimination</span></a></span>, the principle that it should not exist is widely accepted.</span><span class="p">Feminism has brought about many changes in the English language. Many words for job titles that included ‘man’ have been replaced, for example ‘police officer’ is used instead of ‘policeman’ and ‘ <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/chair#chair_1" title="chair definition"><span class="ndv">chair</span></a> ’ or ‘ <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/chairperson" title="chairperson definition"><span class="ndv">chairperson</span></a> ’ for ‘chairman’. ‘He’ is now rarely used to refer to a person when the person could be either a man or woman. Instead, <span class="eb">he or she</span>, or sometimes <span class="eb">(s)he</span>, and in Britain in particular, <span class="eb">they</span>, is preferred. The title <span class="eb">Ms</span> is commonly used for women instead of ‘Miss’ or ‘Mrs’, since, like 'Mr', it does not show whether a person is married or not.</span></span></span></div><span class="topic-g"><span class="prefix">Topics </span><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/topic/social-issues?level=c2" title="Topic social-issues"><span class="topic" href="l2:politics_and_society:social_issues?cefr=c2"><span class="topic_name">Social issues</span><span class="topic_cefr">c2</span></span></a></span> </li><li class="sense" hclass="sense" htag="li" id="womensliberation_sng_2" sensenum="2"><span class="sensetop" hclass="sensetop" htag="span"><div class="variants" hclass="variants" htag="div" type="alt"><span class="v-g"><span class="v">Women’s Liberation</span></span></div><div class="variants" hclass="variants" htag="div" type="vf">(also <span class="v-g"><span class="labels" hclass="labels" htag="span">informal</span> <span class="v">Women’s Lib</span></span>)</div></span> <span class="def" hclass="def" htag="span">the movement that aimed to achieve equal legal, social and economic rights for women</span> </li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_women_s_lib_1_gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_women_s_lib_1_gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_women_s_lib_1_us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_women_s_lib_1_us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
