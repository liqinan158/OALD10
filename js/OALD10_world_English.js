English is learned by many more people worldwide as a <span class="eb">foreign language</span>. English has many regional varieties such as South African English and Indian English and has also developed as a <span class="eb">global language</span> or <span class="eb">international language</span>, used as a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/lingua-franca" title="lingua franca definition"><span class="ndv">lingua franca</span></a></span> (shared language), sometimes called <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/elf#elf_2" title="ELF definition"><span class="ndv">ELF</span></a></span> <span class="gloss" hclass="gloss" htag="span">(= English as a Lingua Franca)</span> between people for whom it is not a first language. It is estimated that now only one out of every four users of the language speaks English as their first language.</span><span class="p">English has achieved the status of a world language over a long period of time, and for various historical and cultural reasons. In the 17th century English was spread by people going from Britain to live in America, and in the 18th and 19th centuries by the growth of the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-british-empire#the_british_empire_topg_1" title="British Empire definition"><span class="ndv">British Empire</span></a>. Many countries which were part of the empire kept English as their official language after they became independent because there were several local languages. As an official language, English is generally used in government, public administration and the law, and children may be taught in English. Since the middle of the 20th century, English has been an official language of international organizations such as the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-united-nations" title="United Nations definition"><span class="ndv">United Nations</span></a>.</span><span class="p">Economic factors are also important. Britain and the US are both major business and financial centres, and many companies that now operate in several countries started in Britain or the US. Elsewhere, a knowledge of English is often seen as necessary for success in business, and in countries which have many tourists.</span><span class="p">Advances in technology and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/telecommunication" title="telecommunications definition"><span class="ndv">telecommunications</span></a> have also helped to establish English as a global language. Many inventions important to modern life, for example, electricity, radio and the telephone, were developed in Britain or the US. English became the language for international communications in <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/air-traffic-control" title="air traffic control definition"><span class="ndv">air traffic control</span></a> and shipping. Now, major computer systems and software developers are based in the US, and English is one of the main languages used on the internet.</span><span class="p">Britain and the US have invested in the development of <span class="eb">English Language Teaching</span> (<span class="eb">ELT</span>). The <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-british-council" title="British Council definition"><span class="ndv">British Council</span></a> has offices across the world which promote British culture and support the teaching of English. The United States also has libraries and cultural programmes in many countries. The English language broadcasts of the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-bbc-world-service" title="BBC World Service definition"><span class="ndv">BBC World Service</span></a>, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-voice-of-america" title="Voice of America definition"><span class="ndv">Voice of America</span></a> and other services are widely popular, and many people listen to the news broadcasts in order to get news about events in their own country. The <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/bbc" title="BBC definition"><span class="ndv">BBC</span></a> and Voice of America also broadcast programmes for people who are learning English.</span><span class="p">As an international language, English continues to develop. People who speak English as a first or second language have their own variety of the language, and each variety continues to change. There are many differences, for instance, between British English and American English, and between Australian, South African, Indian, African and Jamaican English, though all can be understood, more or less, by speakers of other varieties. People who are learning English learn one of the major varieties, usually British or American English, or a variety of international English. As a global language, English can no longer be thought of as belonging only to British or American people, or to anyone else. As the number of people using English as a second or foreign language is increasing faster than the number who speak it as a first language, further movement away from a British or American standard is likely.</span><span class="p">The status of English as a global language has meant that fewer British and American people are learning foreign languages, with the number of students choosing to study foreign languages at university falling every year.</span></span></span></div></li></ol></div></div></body></html><audio id="OALD10_pron_world_english_1_gb_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_world_english_1_gb_1.mp3"></audio><audio id="OALD10_pron_world_english_1_us_1" preload="none" src="OALD10_pron_world_english_1_us_1.mp3"></audio>`;
