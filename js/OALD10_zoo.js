Children are given soft toy animals and picture books about animals.

People feed wild birds in the winter and some have a bird table in the garden. In the US the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) helps people to create their own ' <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/backyard" title="backyard definition"><span class="ndv">backyard</span></a> wildlife <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/habitat#habitat_1" title="habitat definition"><span class="ndv">habitat</span></a>'.</span><span class="p">There are often campaigns to save species that are <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/endangered" title="endangered definition"><span class="ndv">endangered</span></a></span>, such as <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/wolves" title="wolves definition"><span class="ndv">wolves</span></a> and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/buffalo#buffalo_1" title="buffalo definition"><span class="ndv">buffalo</span></a> in the US, and red <span class="ndv" href="squirrel_subentryg_1:squirrel_topg_2" tofix="">squirrels</span> and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/hedgehog" title="hedgehogs definition"><span class="ndv">hedgehogs</span></a> in Britain. In rural areas people generally have much less romantic ideas about animals. In Britain hunting <span class="ndv" href="fox_subentryg_1:fox_topg_2" tofix="">foxes</span> with dogs is opposed by many people, especially those living in towns, but the law to ban it, which came into effect in 2005, is seen by many people living in the country as an attack on their way of life. There is also a lot of discussion about whether the numbers of <span class="ndv" href="badger_subentryg_1:badger_topg_2" tofix="">badgers</span>, which are a type of wild animal living in the countryside, should be reduced. They are thought to pass on the disease <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/tuberculosis" title="tuberculosis definition"><span class="ndv">tuberculosis</span></a> to cows, and therefore many farmers are in favour of a reduction in their numbers. Other people feel that it is wrong to kill badgers and that other solutions to the problem should be found.</span><span class="p">In Britain and the US many people are concerned about <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/animal-rights" title="animal rights definition"><span class="ndv">animal rights</span></a></span>, especially the use of animals in scientific research and public pressure has forced many <span class="ndv" href="cosmetic_subentryg_1:cosmetic_topg_2" tofix="">cosmetics</span> companies to stop testing products on animals.
